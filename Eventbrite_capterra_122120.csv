Eventbrite,5-May,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-May,5-May,"Our goal is to encourage our Facebook audiences to attend more virtual events and provide them with the exact information and details they need, all housed in one concise place and Eventbrite has been the perfect tool for us. The analytics and reporting are very robust, especially for a free plan.","The setup and ease of use for a first time Eventbrite user/manager was incredibly easy and seamless. The feature that is most useful to us is the Facebook event integration - and the best part - it's free. This way, our social media audiences can register for tickets directly through the Facebook event published on Facebook. It's such a powerful feature and so incredibly easy to setup.","I wish there was an abilitty to make updates to the address after an event has already been published. With COVID-19, we had to shift from an in-person event to make it a virtual event and because we had to change the address, Eventbrite woudn't allow it. Suggestion - if an address needs to be changed, Eventbrite could automatically send an email to the list of attendees or a calendar notification of the change.

The Mailchimp feature is extremely limited and I have trouble understanding what exactly the purpose of it is. I have not doubt that Eventbrite will enhance it in the future with incorporate more robust functions because Eventbrite is really great with continually improving their tools.",Squarespace,"The Facebook integration was seamless and is a very powerful feature, that's also free.",19-Jul-20

I'd especially recommend to nonprofit users who produce live event programming.,"There's something about the Eventbrite platform that feels particularly inclusive. I really like how customizable it is, and it's easy to train on. I'm also a big fan of their reporting and analytics.",I have nothing bad to say about this particular software.

It's easy to use, easy to share, easy to on-board. I love this software and highly recommend it.","I don't have any complaints about this product.

Eventbrite,5-Mar,5-May,5-Jan,5-Feb,5-Jan,Extremely painful.,Eventbrite is easy to use. It's designed well.,"Customer service really stinks at Eventbrite. They're just looking to get paid. Their fees are high, sometimes 15-20% depending upon your ticket price. They had agreed on our festival to payout daily leading up to the event but changed their mind when COVID hit (to hoard cash and save themselves while screwing their event organizers.) Now they are expecting people to pull off multi-million dollar festivals without collecting any of their ticketing money up front. The worst part is they froze our payouts without telling us, until one day we noticed the lack of deposits and logged into Eventbrite to find it. Surprise surprise! They have refused to renegotiate the contract but also refuse to release funds so we can pull off our event. Eventbrite is going to bring the event industry crashing down due to the way they handled COVID.",AudienceView Select,A better negotiated deal originally - but they did not stick by their deal as they stopped paying out before the event once the pandemic hit causing us major cashflow issues.  Lesson we learned: you can't trust what Eventbrite tells you.,13-Sep-20
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-May,5-Mar,5-Mar,5-Apr,The actual event turned out to be a big success.  Eventbrite played a key role in that success.  I would definitely consider Eventbrite for future events.,"Eventbrite is easy to understand and use.  The feature-set is not too broad so it's easy to quickly understand everything they offer.  I was able to quickly wrap my mind around its scope and deploy an event.  I appreciated how easy it was to setup a website for reservations and payment.  Although I did not have alot of design options for the payment and reservation pages, the pages were streamlined and worked well.  I was able to find good third-party support for lanyards and printed name badges.  Being able to sell tickets at the entrance was a nice feature as well.  

Pricing felt right.  I received good value for the money I spent.",I did not have alot of design flexibility for the payment and reservation pages.  I pretty much had to stick with their default template that makes all Eventbrite sites look the same.  The event management UI was slow and awkward to use.  I did have a couple of periods of site outage that caused me some pain.,Cvent Event Management,"Cvent looked to be a superior solution, but it was outrageously expensive.  It was way beyond my budget.  Eventbrite was the right price.",29-Sep-20
Eventbrite,5-May,5-Apr,5-May,5-Apr,5-Apr,This is a great program for reserving spaces at events (we have only had free events that this was necessary for so I can't speak to events that you would like your attendees to pay for.) that have a finite amount of tickets.,"I love how organized it keeps our organization when we have free event that have limited seating. We are able to track who is signed up, contact everyone with important event information, check people in and see where they signed up from(website, Facebook, etc.) if you are charging for tickets, there is a small fee but because I have used it for free events, I would be willing to pay for that if we were to charge for an event. It is really well thought out overall.","As a designer, I would like a few more options to be able to customize the event page. You are only able to customize a description and a specific size image.  I struggled though to even find this con because it really is a great software.",Wufoo,"It gave us the ability to let people reserve more than on ticket and make sure we didn't overbook our event. We usually use Wufoo for most of our events because of its ability to add a lot of things (and we still love Wufoo, just not for this) we need it to but we couldn't figure out how to not overbook and also allow a family to reserve multiple tickets for all of its members.",26-May-20
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,ten thumbs up,this software has made the job of creating our parish event family nights the easiest it could be  since we've hit these months of darkeness and mystery of social distancing and masking and not being reassured if our volunteer jobs resume at the church month to month to help father with the technology upgrades yet to come,it has taken some integration to learn at first coming out as a highschool graduate in 2009 coming from a small city highschool and being asked to take on a huge roll when i moved to the wausau deanery churches when my teachers told them how computer smart i was and that i could handle any program with ease i thought looking back teaching software ten years later i sure would not have expected this at my young age and now teaching k-4 the same areas except on a tablet for each one of them during camp since we can't use paper during the pandemic,Notepad++,its simplicity and overall expierience since using it in highschool.,20-Oct-20
Eventbrite,5-May,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-May,5-May,"I have used Eventbrite to manage RSVPs for very small, free events up to multi-thousand dollar galas. It makes the processes of ticketing, collecting information, and checking in guests at an event incredibly easy.","Like the headline says, the best part of Eventbrite is that you can go from sign-in to selling tickets in minutes. The workflow is solid and easy to use for a simple event, but allows a ton of customization for advanced users.","As amazing as the feature set is, it takes quite a long time for pages to load on the backend and I hoping that gets improved at some point. The multi-user system also needs a bit more work--it looks like it hasn't been updated since I started using the software back in 2012.",Wufoo and SurveyMonkey,Eventbrite was the only tool of the three that was entirely focused on event registration.,20-Aug-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,,"The platform eliminates the need for face to face ticket sales/ purchases. It is quite secure and ensures that your information is kept safely. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who's planning to execute an event, as well as, purchase tickets. Tickets are easily add to mobile wallets from this app.",The dividend per ticket sales might be relativity high depending on cost of tickets.,Mobilize,The setup seem to be easier than other platforms.,29-Sep-20
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-Mar,5-Apr,5-Apr,"Overall I think Eventbrite is a fantastic event management software that is inclusive of every type of event, and the options available to you without having to part with any money are very good.","Using Eventbrite to manage your events is quick and easy. My favourite feature is the customisable form, and the ability to replicate events. You have a number of options for payment and tracking.","You are limited when trying to customise your event and brand it as your own. 

When using the professional package you only get support with paid events.",,,22-Sep-20
Eventbrite,5-May,5-Apr,5-May,5-May,5-May,"Overall it was an amazing experience.  We registered 100-125 participants with 10 pieces of mandatory information (it was a chess tournament so school, grade, level, rating, uscf id, address, phone number, cc number, child's name, parent's name).  Parents found the form and payment incredibly easy to complete.  The email confirmation is a nice feature.  The nature of a chess tournament is that you have to register and check-in 100-125 participants in about 30 minutes on the day of the event, and have the information fields loaded into your system the night before.  Eventbrite was a perfect solution for this scenario.  Free-templated website builders tend to limit the number of data fields you can collect and hiring someone was not an economical or efficient option.  The record of payment and list of participants was also helpful.  
Setting up the first Eventbrite event was moderately time-consuming and not the easiest to get the appearance as one would like...but with some tinkering it proved to be great.  Once the first event was formatted...the other 2 events we hosted were super easy to replicate","Eventbrite does a fantastic job of making itself accessible to users attending your event...and it helps tremendously with signing up a large number of participants and collecting fees.  As a volunteer chess coach I was able to use Eventbrite in place of designing a website, and buying a credit card reader or square type solution.  We successfully hosted three 100-125 person events (chess tournaments) and it was an amazing...5 star out of 5 star application for that size event and that frequency.",The cost (cut that Eventbrite takes out) is high.  If you are running a low volume (less than 50) event...I would recommend using the free version of Eventbrite for sign up and just collect the money onsite.  If you are doing a higher volume event I would recommend either hiring a helper to collect the money and invest in a square reader (or if frequent events...maybe even look into website design with payment acceptance built in).  For my particular event...more information fields were needed than what free template websites allow...and Eventbrite was fantastic at being able to accommodate those needs.  I love everything about the way Eventbrite works...but be careful on the cost analysis side.  For us...it was the most economic/efficient way for one person to register 100-125 participants efficiently.  Plan for a close to 14%-18% cut...so the efficiency and convenience that Eventbrite provides has to be worth that percentage.  For my particular situation...it absolutely was.,,"The simplicity of being able to host the event solo without help.  Getting a chess tournament started on-time is a significant part of the experience for kids and parents and Eventbrite helped stream-line the process down to where I could manage all of the moving parts.  Not having to deal with payments on the day of the event increased my sanity and enjoyment by many, many percentage points...so the fee that Eventbrite takes makes it worth it.  There is also an option to pass the fee along to participants...so don't let the fee completely run you off.  Once in operation...the Eventbrite product performs its task superbly.",13-Aug-20
Eventbrite,5-May,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-May,5-May,"I am very pleased with the services provided with Eventbrite.  It streamlines and centralizes so many processes involved in planning a conference.  It also helps us keep on track, advertise with social media, and track data on attendees.  It's an incredible option worth considering, especially if you are hosting/leading a free event.","Eventbrite is an incredible platform for managing events and conferences.  Here are a few reasons you'll enjoy it:
- It's extremely user-friendly.  Of course basic, background tech skills are helpful, but it's easy to get up and going and learn to navigate.  
- Similarly, the user interface is nicely designed.  Nothing tricky or odd in my opinion - the webpage design just makes sense.
- You can use it across multiple types of devices - not just limited to your laptop.  
- As long as your event is free, you can use Eventbrite for free - that's pretty incredible.
- The web platform has always been quick and responsive with no glitches/errors.
- It integrates seamlessly with many other platforms that you may be using when organizing an event (Sched, social media, etc.).  This is great for promoting!
- There are lots of customization features.  I feel like I've only scratched the surface with all that's available.
- Effortlessly creates scanning systems for participants.
- Although not as powerful as the website, there is a mobile version that is growing with features.
- I just love that Eventbrite streamlines so many things for me.  Instead of having to jump between multiple tools/platforms for multiple purposes, Eventbrite centralizes a lot involved in our process.","I have very little to complain about with this platform, but I do think there is room for improvement with customer support.  There response time was good, but could improve.  It might be helpful to build out a better FAQ or help system in the website, since there isn't a lot of blogs or help available from other sources.  Next, we offer a free event for educators, but I think the service charge would be expensive and cut into profits if our event was a paid conference.","Ticketbud, Gather and Fonteva for Associations","Eventbrite was user-friendly, free to use for our event, and I was familiar with the platform from other conferences.",30-Oct-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,"Overall my experience with Eventbrite has been fun, positive, and exciting. I love searching for community, charity, and music events to go to with my friends and family. Especially in the summer, there are so many festivals and shows going on that it can be hard to keep track, and all I have to do is search the type of event I'm looking for or the date, or enjoy looking through what they have on their homescreen and scroll until I find something I'm interested in (which is usually never a long time!). I have really enjoyed my experience with Eventbrite and would highly recommend. I have registered for and gone to numerous events that I only discovered through eventbrite with my family and friends many often, and I will happily continue using it!","I LOVE using Eventbrite to find all the local events going on around me. I go to shows and events often and I love this website so much for having so many things that are going on in one place. I love the website, it looks alive, updated, and active. The website alone has a nice look that suits its own purpose. What I love most about this service is that I can find more intimate community events that are closer to me, such as 5K's and even charity golf events, etc. that I can't normally find on ""bigger"" event websites. There is a wide range of events to choose from, and I love that they include community and charity events as well. I also love the checking out process, it is so user friendly and I feel secure checking out. Oh I almost forgot- I also absolutely love that I can 'search' for what event, place, and date I am interested in. I can type in ""charity"" and an entire list pops up, and I really appreciate the convenience and central location of finding out what's happening around me.","As with most event and ticketing websites, there is a fee to check out when buying tickets for any events that are not free. This is to be expected, and probably the only thing I ""dislike"" about this service. Otherwise I love that I have a range of free and ticketed events to choose from, and that for free events I can go ahead and register from Eventbrite. No other complaints here!!",,,15-Sep-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-Apr,5-May,"It's good for anybody that's organizing an event obviously, the nice thing about Eventbrite is that it's free to use long as you're not charging for the event. There is a fee if you are charging for the event so the fees are 2.5% plus 99 cents transaction fee. So that's a service fee to Eventbrite for using their platform. Again, this is only if you're charging for the ticket, and then if there's a credit card use, then the credit card fee is 3.5% which is quite high, but when you factor in the time to chase attendees for invoice payments it's kind of a no brainer 

From an implementation perspective, it's super easy to use, you just have to sign up and then build out your event page. The usability is super easy peasy, there are some options that take a little longer to get used to, but overall it's quite easy to use.","The top feature for Eventbrite is that it's really easy to track events and the attendees that are coming to your events. You can create an event very easily, share it across multiple platforms, there's a direct link to your Facebook business events page from Eventbrite. Making it super easy to get the word out.

 You can track the events that are sent out and how people found your event so you can get a sense of where people are looking to find out about events and then put your efforts into advertising in those channels later on. 

You can print name tags which is really awesome, so if you have an event where you want to everyone to wear name tags, rather than getting everybody to write them out when they can show up and you already have them printed. 

And then finally, there is a huge audience that uses Eventbrite, so you'll find that getting the word out is a lot easier. People will do a search for types of events like yours, find your event, and show up which is great because you had to work very little to get them to come to your event.","So, some of the requested features; we would like to see more customization in the actual Eventbrite page itself and as well the emails that are sent out to your invitees. So at the moment, I think there's only two templates and you can't really do much to change the look and feel, or the text within it, so it would be great to be able to customize those features a little bit.",,,17-Apr-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-Apr,,5-Apr,5-May,"The event I attended which was managed via Eventbrite hat serval hundred attendees. From a visitors perspective anything worked flawlessly and smooth. The event I set up was a lot smaller but also worked out great from an organizers point of view. I am confident Eventbrite played a central role to this as it streamlined the organisation and the preparation as well as positively supported the execution of the events. Eventbrite is a modern, fast and anticipating web application that is easy to use and works for teams colaborating in organizing small and obviously medium to large sized events. It also funnels some of your more exotic ideas about how your event should work down a reasonable lane, which is healthy, es pecially for newcomers and the less experienced.  I simply can recommend Eventbrite and will use it again for our followup event(s) in 2019.","I used Eventbrite a couple of times when booking events for myself or colleagues. It was simple, easy, had the information I was looking for where I expected it to be and all (comprehensive) steps that led me through researching the event (MTP Hamburg) to choosing what I specifically wanted to finalizing booking completely without any hassle. A while later I had to organize an Event myself and remembered my positive experience as a user, which I wanted to provide to attendees of my event as well. It was then, that I realized how much this has to do with the way you setup an event from inside Eventbrite. There is a verry good guide for setting up events and a step by step tour for beginners. There also are recommendations about what to do when and what information might be expected by potential attendees. I liked the basic support which was included as a beginner. Also, there are areas where Eventbrite clearly draws a line regarding its functionalities and forwards you to connected third party services (as for example if you want super fancy badges or have more esoteric data mining procedures in mind regarding your attendees data).  As a newbie to event management AND Eventbrite in particular I was also happy about the broad spectrum of FAQ and help videos. I was very happy to be supplied with a solution that provided me with high quality, easy to use features and was free to use for my non-profit event on top of it.",Speaking of FAQ and learning how to use Eventbrite it is true that there is a lot of material available online. Sadly there is also light and shadow to this. Some of the explanations I found online were clearly dated and others did either not cover the specifics of the topic I needed (recommendation / invitation based multi stepp application requests) or referred to things which had been changed in the past. Also the Options for the design and look of the Event Homepage were limited. These aren't necessarily bad things only. BEing forced to stay with a simple (but still beautiful) Layout as well as required to go with a simpler application process then I imagined in the end turned out to be good as it simplified things and allowed me to concentrate on matters more central to the event I was planning. It just needed some letting go first and willingness to do it differently than I first had imagined.,,,24-Nov-18
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-Apr,,5-Apr,"With a large number of ""event applications"" out there, Eventbrite has found its way to the top of that list thanks mostly to their easy to use interface and well thought out back-end that not only covers all of an event host's bases but also integrates with other areas of their marketing. Free to anyone who isn't requiring payment for tickets, Eventbrite makes it easy to quickly put together a good looking registration page fast, without the hassle of payment or subscriptions. The paid feature for anyone requiring ticket fees is a little more rigid in how the user can collect it's money which can make it a little tougher to work with depending on how badly you need the revenue from your ticket sales. The payment processing fees are still reasonable, though.","-Powerful system that provides a large number of great features (creating, promoting, tracking, checking-in, analyzing) for free
-Event page creation is quick and easy. If you want something simple, you can be done in minutes. If you want to customize different areas of the design and registration process, you have that ability as well.
-Integrations with outside marketing platforms like HubSpot and MailChimp allow the user to connect their other marketing platforms together to create the most powerful event marketing toolset you could ask for. 
-Relatively good analytics and reporting sections gives you solid insight into how successful your event was and where you can improve moving forward.
-The mobile application (Neon) for event hosts makes checking in attendants a breeze by either scanning the printed tickets Eventbrite provides or just finding their name and swiping your finger across it!
-Customer support is relatively attentive (I've averaged around 3-5 minutes on hold before speaking to a representative via phone) and the knowledge base they've set up on their website it pretty helpful when it comes to answering some of your intermediate-level questions around customization and platform functionality.","-The paid feature is a little rigid when it comes to payout structure compared to other options. You normally can't receive payout for your ticket revenue until your event ends, making it a tough option for those looking to promote an event months in advance who need the revenue now. Definitely something to consider. They provide early payout, but depending on how much revenue you're expecting to generate, that may not even be a viable option.
-Customizing your registration page with your brand's colors, logos and images can be difficult and require some coding skills. You also won't be able to get rid of the Eventbrite branding so anyone looking for total design control may not like this option.",,,26-Jan-16
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Mar,5-Mar,5-Apr,5-Mar,"This is a great solution for simple, straightforward events without too many options. Once you get a lot of different sessions or tracks and registration types, it either can't accommodate or becomes very complicated to manage. Like other tools of this nature, there is a bit of a generic feel to it but that is the compromise for a widely accepted overall, plug and play software. It is effective but there are other solutions that are similar or easier to use and offer more customization options. It is highly likely that we will replace this software with something else in the near future.","Eventbrite is fairly simple to use and has most the features you would want laid out so you can build an event registration form in steps. Once you set up your account(s) if you are accepting payments, it is straightforward to duplicate events to make new ones as long as they require similar details. There are custom fields you can create with logic behind them so different users may have different options depending on the access you choose for them. There are also ways to create discount codes or hidden fields with different levels of access. This is very useful when you have tired pricing at events and variable discounts to various groups.","A lot of the settings are in places that don't make much sense and you have to go to completely different sections of the admin section to find settings that you would think are closely related to each other. Some of the features are on by default and you might never notice them until after your event registration has launched. Even though most the settings are easy to change, you basically have to go over every tab, page and setting to be sure they are all correct before you launch your campaign. When you use the custom data fields and discount features, it isn't immediately clear how it all works and again, you need to go to a couple different pages to get them set up properly so it takes some trial and error.",,,11-Sep-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,"Working at a district that does dozens of ticketed events a year anywhere  100 guests to 5000 guests, Eventbrite has made getting people in the door a much faster and easier process. That long line of people waiting to come in quickly disappears because Eventbrite is so fast and easy to use. It has been a game changer for our ticketed events/concerts and I know it can help anyone else who is doing ticketed events as well.","This software is absolutely incredible for anyone doing ticketed events. You can easily see how many tickets are purchased, how many have checked in and the scanner feature is extremely easy to use.  One of my favorite features with the Eventbrite scanner you are able to see if a ticket has already been scanned for that event and exactly what time it was scanned. That allows for less opportunities for people to pass tickets along that have already been used. I also live that you can download the app and turn your own smartphone into a scanner! GAME CHANGER! Switching to these scanners was a fantastic upgrade for our business.","There are only a few minor issues I have encountered but they are more with the actual event brite scanner than it is with the software. If it is extremely hot outside sometimes the batteries on the scanners can drain faster than normal, just make sure you have backups ready to go. They also will not scan tickets purchased from any other outside website (StubHub, Ticketmaster, etc) which is good and bad at the same time.

Furthermore, it can do follow up reminders and keeps track of who opened the invitation, the attendance, and what type of ticket was purchased. Most importantly, it allows you to offer many types of attendance tickets, including a virtual attendance option if you're livestreaming. This is crucial if you're trying to get an accurate headcount of people who will be physically in attendance at your event.","The multi user interface gets a bit tricky during set up.

Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-Jan,5-May,5-Mar,"I organise a lot of professional networking events, some are free and some are paid for. Eventbrite offers me all the functionality I need to organise my event. I used Picatic until Eventbrite recently acquired Picatic. However, customer support from Eventbrite is very difficult, if not existent. So if you have a question not answered by the standard FAQ, such as,  ""Since Eventbrite acquired Picatic, how I can access my previous/ currently live events""?, the only way I could find customer support was by tweeting Eventbrite. So, Eventbrite is great if you can self-service and publish free events, but once you have quirky questions, be prepared that it will be difficult to establish contact to a human person who can answer.","Eventbrite has lots of functionality that you will need when organising and managing an event. It is very easy to use, plus it can integrate with other apps such as Mailchimp which comes in handy when broadcasting an event and Surveymonkey which comes in handy to send out feedback forms post an event.  The back office functionality is great too -- you can email invitations directly without using Mailchimp if you wanted to. For users, it's easy and simple to register, plus Eventbrite offers a secure online payment option which is hassle free for both organiser and attendee.","2 things that I like the least about Eventbrite are: 1) Non-existent customer service. One of the reasons why I used Picatic (which they have now bought!) was due to their great customer service. You can chat with a real person who can help you with some of the questions which are not answered in their FAQs. 2) They're great if you have a free event, but if you have a paid event, their transaction fees are one of the highest in the market.",,,29-Oct-18

Hit it, respond to it, solve it!  Also, so many people are use the service now, I am unaware if it has safe guards against crashing and;  if it does... what happens to my information?  I do think that due to the high percentage of users at any given time, the system slows down considerably.  This can be frustrating when trying to pay for an event or responding to an RSVP.

Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-May,5-May,5-Apr,5-May,"Eventbrite is free for free events, easy to set up and looks professional.","I work at a nonprofit with a small marketing staff. Before using Eventbrite, we were building our events on our website which looked awful and dull. It would take a lot of time for not much reward. With Eventbrite, I can create a basic event in a matter of a few minutes. I can make it private or public to be shared with the Eventbrite community. Best of all, most of our events are free to enter, which means it's free to post them on Eventbrite. It's easy to check attendees in at the door, download reports, and communicate last-minute messages with registrants. Eventbrite is a great tool more companies should take advantage of.","In some instances, we've held events that require many conditional questions to be completed during registration. Unfortunately, Eventbrite doesn't allow the function of complex, conditional questions, which can really slow down the registration process. On the backend, the menu names aren't the most intuitive. There are certain functions that are difficult to find, such as where to cancel an order, but after expanding each sidebar menu, you can usually find which what you need. My biggest pet peeve with Eventbrite is that if you create an event that takes place more then five weeks away, ticket sales will automatically be set to end in five weeks from that date, regardless of when your event takes place. There have been many times when I've forgotten to change this default date and received complaints of ticket sales being closed weeks prior to an event. I wish Eventbrite would make the default date the date of the event.",,,31-Jan-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-Apr,5-May,"The problem that I was able to solve was spending less time on event coordination- I was wasting too much time emailing individual people about events. Because I now waste less time on E-Mail campaigning, I can spend more time doing things that benefit the organization better. Additional benefits that I realized are the creative capabilities that the software allows. I do not have any graphic design experience but was able to create creative and attractive content for E-Mail campaigns.","the most helpful part of using Eventbrite is that I can automate my E-Mail campaigns and event invites for FREE! That's right, it cost my organization no money to automate event planning and E-Mail campaigns! The upside to Eventbrite is that you can set up campaigns months in advance. When I was leaving my job, I wanted to make sure that events and other activities did not fall through the cracks, so I automated event updates and reminders for the next two months after I left.",I dislike that the software does give you very much flexibility when it comes to creating content.

Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,,"Eventbrite is extremely versatile. I have used it to create events, to purchase tickets or RSVP to events and frequently, to search for events. To create an event page, Eventbrite makes it as easy as possible for you. From there, you have easy access to who is and isn't attending, and also receive a guestlist for your event which you can use for check-in. From personal experience on the user side, I love that once you've RSVPed, you get a clear confirmation email that allows you to easily 'add' the event to your calendar of choice (or you can do this from the Eventbrite page right after you've RSVPed), and Eventbrite plugs in all the relevant information into your calendar. This always saves me so much time and usually encourages me to attend the event. I imagine that the participants signing up for events I have created in the past have also enjoyed this feature.","There is not a lot of customization available. You don't get to control the font/size or other design-related aspects of the event page so the event information and photo are all presented in the same way for each event.

Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-Apr,,"As a huge live music fan, Eventbrite has been a great way for me to find and organize my live music itinerary. They are my go-to option for discovering local music events, and the ease with which you can purchase tickets and use them in other apps (such as Apple wallet) has really made the concert going experience easier for me. I appreciate the smooth functionality of the app, and its suggestions about events I would enjoy based on those I have previously attended. Highly recommended.","Eventbrite presents a very smooth interface, and is a great and easy way to discover and purchase tickets to events. I love it that it allows you to add any tickets purchased through the software to your Apple wallet, and I also appreciate that it keeps an archive of all the past tickets that you've used through them; for those like me who enjoy keeping their physical tickets as a memento of sorts, this app does it for your digital tickets automatically. All of my transactions with Eventbrite feel safe and secure.","One time I purchased tickets for a concert, but ended up missing it due to something unforeseen coming up. This was the only event that the app did NOT keep a record of - the tickets have disappeared from my past archive. I would like to see this tweaked where the app saves not only the tickets used, but also those unused.",,,7-Jan-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,"What do you like best?
If you know what you like and you choose your interests accordingly, the recommendations are always spot on. It's hard not to find something that would interest you and there are always lots of free events. I had to download the app before I moved to Glasgow because I bought a conference ticket through Eventbrite, but then I started to tinker with it out of curiosity and it quickly became a very useful tool. I was new in the city and it quickly exposed me to a lot of stuff I wouldn't have known about otherwise, I even managed to sneak into an Industry Day type event only older students were supposed to know about (and it was great, by the way).

What do you dislike?
I can't think about any major things I disliked about this service. There used to be some synchronisation issues between what I was doing on my laptop and what I was doing on the Android app, but they seem to be gone now. Not being able to see your own location when you click on the map is mildly inconvenient if you're in a hurry, but most of the time I add the events to my planner in advance and just clicking on the location I typed in there will take me to Google Maps. The only problem with this is that Google Maps could lead you to the wrong place if it has a similar name, I once went to the Patrick Terminal for something that was supposed to be in the City Centre and, earlier than that, it led me to some random agency in the City Centre for a photography exhibition that was actually in the East End.

Recommendations to others considering the product
You should only pick the interests you actually have. That's what the settings are for and even if you're afraid of missing out on something else, looking for events in an overwhelming sea of information isn't exactly productive.

What business problems are you solving? What benefits have you realized?
Animation is a terribly competitive industry and you need lots of experience and connections to actually get inside. Even going to events that are only half related, like the ones about film, design, art, computer games and so on will get you into mailing lists, local and global communities and all kinds of other things you wouldn't have found out about by yourself. This creates a chain reaction and a lot more opportunities will find their way to you.",,,,,8-Oct-16

A few technical items:
-  It would be great if the reserved seating function let customers reserve their own seats AND it forced them to reserve seats without allowing to have an empty seat in-between. You can see this function by reserving seats at the Hale Center Theater (https://hct.org/).
- It would be great if someone could purchase tickets using a promo code AND purchase un-comped tickets at the same time (instead of having to go back into the system and starting all over to buy more tickets after the comped tix were obtained). If you have to go into the system twice you may not be able to sit next to your friends.  We need this functionality because we give our VIP's a certain amount of comped tickets and then they have first access to purchasing extra tickets for their friends. We'd love for them to sit together.",It's great for general admission. And good for reserved seating.,"(1) Customer service. So far it has been almost impossible to get a hold of them.
(2) Reserved seating does not allow customers to select their own seats AND refuse them from leaving an empty seat. Hale Center Theater allows you to do both. You can see more at https://hct.org/online/.  I'd love to see Eventbrite incorporate this feature. Maybe they do but I haven't been able to get a hold of anyone and started reaching out on Tuesday. It's Friday.

Some are free events where I need to collect user information, others are paid events where I have to collect dietary information for meals, and other events could just be a place for me to collect payment for a collective order. No matter the event, I've found a way to use Eventbrite and save myself so much time! I use to use internal spreadsheets for everything, and accept mailed payments. Thanks to Eventbrite, I can share a link and move on to the next task on my list!","Eventbrite can do so much, it's really irreplaceable. I think something that could take Eventbrite to the next level is a seating arrangement function.

Their UI is incredibly easy to navigate and so straightforward to setup a page quickly. They also offer free events so you can use Eventbrite for free if you're not charging for tickets. They also have a great community forum for every city where people can search for Eventbrite events happening near them and also receive email updates on these local events.,"Eventbrite's landing pages are pretty hard-coded where there isn't a ton of flexibility to the design and overall branding. The system also isn't designed that great for nonprofits. Often for nonprofit events, a donor may buy a ticket where part of their transaction is tax deductible but another part is not. Eventbrite doesn't have a field to capture the tax deductible amount per ticket, so the nonprofit has to manually go in and calculate that amount per ticket when they're generating tax summaries to send at the end of the year.",,,11-Jan-20

Also, their customer care is great. We are currently still getting pricing from 3 years ago, which is why I can't imagine ever letting this software go.

Event brite also notifies you through email on every inquiry or reply you get. You can not find any application or software that would match How Event Brite is performing and all members are satisfied and happy with it.","I am satisfied with its performance, features and events all over the world can be accessed. I just hope that Eventbrite can think of exploring more features taking each event to the next level. Maybe someday it would have this feature where regardless of what location or country you are, you can also have the feature of making international talents perform in a different country.

Eventbrite also captures various analytics on your events (that can be viewed within the applications dashboard or easily exported) that help you analyze and understand your audience, where your traffic is coming from, and keep track of sales, etc. One of its best features is the availability to access details and analytics on your event at any time, from any advice, so you can save on time and focus on other important matters.","The free version does not provide you with the option to ask registrants questions when they are in the process of purchasing their tickets.

And at the end of it, I had excel sheets and data to help show how my ticket selling went.

Honestly, the few times I didn't use Eventbright for events, I wholly regretted that decision and paid for it by having to do personal work that eventbright would do instead.","Its easy to use, it provides all the necessary logistical tools an event planner will need and its very cheap/ reasonably priced for the service it provides (mainly reducing the headache and stress of planning an event)",It doesn't allow a lot of aesthetic customization.

Eventbrite did very much help us to be able to sell tickets to a broader audience and organize them as best we could.

It's very easy to move through the process and set up an event without many hiccups or training.","I least like the flexibility in designing the event webpage. I understand Eventbrite's need to use their branding and layout, but it would be helpful if you could edit the event webpage to match your branding such as add more pictures, upload a background color, use different texts, and colors.

It is very easy to use and the site lets you do more than just put a time and date. We especially love the password option.

We wish it was more of a 'click RSVP' and  you're done, but attendees have to put in their card information, which slows down the process.

The ability to filter by mood, categories, dates or to be surprised help to hone in on the right event for your situation.","If you are planning to use EventBrite to sell tickets the platform gets more complicated and structured, including the limited ways in which you can receive money for tickets.  My professional organization considered using it for small fee ticket sales for member events but the rules and at the percentage taken by EventBrite were restrictive to the point that we didn't move forward.

Overall, it allowed me to achieve my goal, which was to invite people to our holiday party and be able to track the RSVPs.","I used EventBrite to create and distribute invitations to our company's annual holiday party. I was able to input all of the event's details rather quickly and easily, and was even able to upload the invitation that I designed to add it to our 'page' for our event. It's sleek looking, and was fairly straightforward to configure.","It's not very intuitive. It took me quite a few Google searches just to figure out how to send a reminder email to all of the non-responders.

You can add the ticket/barcode to your apple wallet for easy access. It keeps all upcoming and past tickets separated  in case you need to look back on things but you don't have to weed through them.  I am a huge calendar user, so I also really like that  you can add it directly to your calendars.

We host many events, and Eventbrite gives us a venue to issue tickets, track attendees, and promote our events.  I like that it's easy to create events, customize options, & order forms. You can print attendee lists an other reports, which really makes this a one-stop shop if you are hosting an event.  I also like that there are paid options available to integrate with your already existing CRM platforms.","The only thing I can think of that I can knock on with Eventbrite is that sometimes it's hard to hide your events from those other than who it is intended for.  It's a simple fix if you check a box, but if you forget it creates a mess of canceling orders for those who may already have your event information.",,,21-Nov-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-Mar,,"I like Eventbrite due to the amount of automation that comes with this product. It's easy to set up integrations such that once someone buys a ticket, they're automatically added to an email list. The partial refund ability is excellent and way better than manual refunds, and the ability to white label is excellent. Overall, Eventbrite has the most robust and customizable features for event ticketing platforms.","Honestly, the fees are the worst thing about Eventbrite. There are a variety of softwares that do almost all the things that Eventbrite does with way lower fees and because I work with clients who want a high level of customization and attention to the registration, we can do the manual parts of the registration process in order to avoid using EB and thus, avoiding the large fees.",,,5-Nov-19

Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-May,5-Apr,5-Mar,5-Apr,They are our registration system for all events and they connect to our CRM API for integration so it merges our constituents.  They also send info to Crowdrise for the peer-to-peer fundraising.,It is easy to utilize and set up for any event we have.,It is a bit outdated on how it merges with our CRM and the features.  We use it for endurance events and banquets but endurance events are harder to tailor and they are better at ticket events.,,,19-Mar-19

You can use your own theme and graphics or they have lots of great themes to choose from. I like being able to make it a free rsvp only event or one people can pay for and that you can check people in that have already registered once they get to the event! So helpful!","I can't think of many cons to Eventbrite, but if I had to choose something, I'd say sometimes when I create my own theme that it saves with a funny color and when I choose a different one, it didn't save. Not a huge deal, thought.",,,12-Feb-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-Apr,5-Apr,,"Cost--if you're not creating paid events, you can keep your usage very inexpensive.  If your IT Department doesn't regularly build sign-up sites for you, this can give you easy functionality on a shoestring budget.  It can be an appreciable cost for low-cost events (because the pricing would comprise a higher percentage of each ticket's revenue), but if you don't have a payment-processing solution, or don't have the financial controls or manual functionality to collect payments, then it's likely worth its value to you.","If you don't go with a custom design, your audience may recognize that you opted for a budget-oriented solution.  That may not be the kind of client signaling you want to send, but the potentially low cost has to come with some kind of trade-off.",,,9-Jan-19

I also love the fact that you can select the type of info you wish to collect from attendees and create a zap in order to have the info transferred to a spreadsheet without having to type it.

Before I published any events, I carefully reviewed terms of service and nothing in my ads promoted anything that violated those terms of use. I wasn't promoting MLM, even though terms of use didn't identify MLM as a violation. I always showed up and feedback from attendees was appreciative of the value I was offering. There wasn't even a sales pitch to buy something from me in the presentations. But my account tickled their unpublished portion of their terms of use.

There is pay function but I haven't used it.  I've used it for promo events I have and want to advertise it out to people.  It goes online free to anyone searching for events in my area.  It's a great tool to track and take payments if you want.  It'll get all the information from your people enrolling so you can track them for the future.  I network with other small businesses and they all use it from instructors like me for an event to coaches and financial advisors.","I can't complain about this software as it is free.

It is also very easy to set up Facebook pixels on the site and have it apply to all of your events.","I don't like it that we are using another piece of software to handle registrations, Eventbrite works great, but our webcast strategy needs some work.

It is beneficial that the purchaser pays the processing fee.","While I like that it asks the purchaser to pay the fee, I wish we had the option to give the purchaser the choice as to whether or not they paid it.  While this might seem a bit contradictory, there are different mind sets with making a donor or ticket purchaser pay the processing fees.

Eventbrite,5-Jan,5-Jan,5-Jan,5-Jan,5-Jan,"My experience of Eventbrite has been very poor. It adds a great deal of time and worry to my working day whenever I have to use Eventbrite and follow up on it. Whenever possible, I avoid Eventbrite, and I have found that with some events and venues, while Eventbrite claims there is no availability, if one is able to circumvent Eventbrite and book directly, there is availability, so Eventbrite often seems a useless, even frustrating and counterproductive, unnecessary 'middle man.' I have had so many variedly negative experiences with Eventbrite, that recently, I decided for events that only book through it, if the event can be missed, it is more productive to not attend the event than deal with Eventbrite.","While I do not actually like anything about this software itself, I do like that, although with considerable difficulty, it enables me to book online for events. I simply wish that events would use different software in order to achieve the same end result of allowing booking online.","I find this software unwelcoming and overly complicated to achieve a seemingly simplistic task. It is even difficult to sign in, and I am rarely sure, even after receiving a confirmation e-mail if I have booked correctly. As a result, I regularly waste time calling the event venue the next day, if a number is provided, to check that all details have been accurately received, and often (not always, but more frequently than I regard as reasonable), despite having received a confirmation e-mail, had I not checked with the venue, I was not booked into the event, which for events with limited space is, of course, potentially especially problematic. As a culture writer, attending arts events is an important aspect of my job, and it is a great time waster and strain whenever an event is done entirely through Eventbrite, as I must check anything possible and still be nervous that I will have trouble attending a sometimes necessary event.",,,20-Jun-19
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,,5-Mar,5-Apr,"My overall experience with Eventbrite has been good. It is perfect for and easy to use when managing smaller simple events. It also looks professional.

The only downside that I experienced was your event accessibility to general public. Whenever you create your event, other people (from outside of your organization) have access to it and are able to RSVP. So going through a list of those RSVP'ed to make sure there are no external people is important (and depending on how long the list is, going through it may also be time consuming).",#NAME?,"- as soon as you create the event, it becomes public. I once had a speaker event created for my students (and it was a free event); and I had 3 external to school people signing up for it. Took me some time to go over the RSVP list to make sure nobody else external was there. 
- not a very helpful tool if you event has multiple sessions/registration tracks/etc.
- very limited customization options",,,6-Feb-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-Apr,5-May,5-Apr,"When it comes to the simple process of creating a ticketed and/or registered event, it can be done simply and quickly with Eventbrite. Customer service is quick to answer questions via chat or email. It does have limitations; however, without paying a subscription cost, it is still an industry leading tool.",Eventbrite makes setting up event invitations and ticket sales seamless for even an inexperienced user. Their template works for almost an function and navigating is fairly intuitive. Many people are familiar with Eventbrite so they're willing to go through the step of clicking into an additional link after reading about the event via social media or email.,"The customizations options are limited. There are not enough options to ask additional questions or gain event related information from the user. The backend data is not easy to access, use or transfer into other applications. While they are cost effective for small organizations, don't be fooled. The fees add up quick. Their per ticket cost is reasonable, but their credit card processing fees are high per industry average.",,,8-Jan-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,"Great for events of all sizes especially when the RSVP requires the guest to make choices. Whether it is a large charity gala or an office Christmas party, Eventbrite is easy to use and makes organizing very simple when accommodating guest preferences.","There are a number of options you can include when sending out event invitations. Minimal hassle for set up. You are able to track ticket sales in real time.  It eliminates manual tracking.  For participants, all the information they need is ready in one location and tickets are distributed right to their email.","The app is great. However, when using the computer you need to sign in for every event email you receive and multiple accounts can't be linked. One email address per account and you need to sign in every time.",,,4-Dec-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-Apr,,I highly recommend eventbrite for any nonprofit  event!,"We used to use cvent, which was very expensive. Eventbrite is giving us almost all of the same features without the huge price tag.
 We can customize the questions so we can easily gather all of the information we need from each attendee. We can schedule reminders to attendees and those who still need to register. We can have all the information we need about attendees and track any changes they make to their registrations in one place. 
 We also used eventbrite to sell tickets for a concert we held last year and it was fantastic. Easy for ticket buyers and we were able to pull lists for the concert that made guest check- in a snap.","If your event is not a ticketed event it does require more thought and planning to make eventbrite work. That said, it is doable bacuse the pages are flexible, they can be customized.",,,11-Jul-18
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-May,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-Apr,,"Our company is constantly holding events for all our distributors around the US. There are a LOT of great features but the cost absolutely can't be beat.  Other apps/programs/software have so many added fees for random features that it becomes an expensive hassle to even hold a single event.  Not so with Eventbrite. We'd been burnt before with all the little hidden fees that it took some convincing the higher ups to get on board with Eventbrite.  Now?  They love it.  Haven't looked back.  It's an easy, hassle-free way to send out mass invites for an exceptional price. Just pump the link into an email and you're good to go. You can even have customizeable discounts and promo codes.  I can keep going but I'll save you the reading.  If you're using a different event planner, switch over.  You'll get glad you did.","I don't like fishing for cons when there aren't any readily apparent, but if I had to say one negative thing about Eventbrite, it would be the customer service.  You'll rarely have need to get in contact with them, but when you do it'll be a struggle.  A few more reps, some more training, and an overall cheerier disposition would do them wonders.",,,6-Jul-18
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-May,,5-Mar,5-May,Overall this is a great app,"Eventbrite is a great application. It is easy to use, Helps sponsors build their email lists and predict who's going to their events.

Easy to navigate, explore, buy tickets to online/virtual events and well as a whole array of free talks, crafts, and interesting discussions to join. During this time where we are all home MUCH more than ever, this provides a great link to the world to learn and explore new and interesting things.","I haven't noticed anything glaring that I DON'T like about this software. I really love it! I can jump on Eventbrite to learn and stay connected to the world, as well as create my own events and invite others to join me. Very easy to use.",,,26-Oct-20
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-May,,5-Mar,,"Overall experience is mixed.  I have definitely had seamless interactions on Eventbright.  The ability to not select ""notify me of similar events"" has improved and I don't get flooded like I used to.  Only complaint is the difficulty in accessing the Join Event for remote events","Very easy to post graphics, professional display for registration, and ability to add donation functionality","In the everything's remote phase - I have received numerous registrations that the Zoom (or other platform) was not accessible from the confirmation.  Great reminders, but useless if you can't access the event.  Even if user error on the setup - guide may need to be improved to assist users.  You want people to attend.",,,10-Oct-20
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,The biggest solution that Evenbrite has provided is that it has allowed me to limit the number of attendees for events at my work. We have several large-scale events that need to have a cap on the number of people who can register and this software has allowed me to do this easily. It has allowed us to manage events and communicate with attendees very easily!,"Eventbrite is really intuitive and easy to use as an administrator setting up an event or as someone who is registering for an event. The software makes it easy to limit the number of attendees for an event, gather RSVP's, communicate to attends, and it is free!",There is nothing that I do not like about Evenbrite. It is a great software solution to manage large scale events and registrations!,,,30-Jun-20
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,"With the use of evenbrite I am able to seek out events that I would like to attend. As I look at different events I love the option of being able to like an event, which then saves it to my likes. This helps me remember what I viewed and interests me. I also like that I am able to contact the hosts and toggle through different options. This helps me network with more individuals of the same interests.",Eventbrite is a website that provides service that's easy to use and most importantly user friendly. There are many categories and locations which I truly appreciate the versatility.,"It seems at times when it is trying to locate my location, it is inaccurate at times. Other than inaccuracy it is a great service.",,,15-Dec-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-Apr,5-May,5-May,,"I used Eventbrite when working on content migration for a big university's alumni clubs. We were creating all the clubs' events and membership subscriptions there as a temporary solution before witching to a new platform that had events integrated. The process of event creations was smooth, effective,  and intuitive.","Evenbrite has a lot to offer to event organizers: a way to build an event page, a way to set up multiple tiers of tickets and discounts, to provide attendees with address and event summary, to add images and logos, and much more, and it they way of assembling all these is pretty straightforward and easy to master.","The event templates do not allow a lot of customization. Also, it takes some time how to add additional admins too the events and how to setup discount codes. But these all is more about the learning curve for the advanced features.",,,11-Nov-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,I really enjoy this app. It has been ingrowing for the last few years and it has became into something really great. Everything is organized and put into whichever topic you may enjoy. Only downfall is that not all events happening in the  town are on there but it is what it is. I highly recommend using this app for fun stuff. I have purchased many tickets off from it and everything is secure and easy to use.,This is one of the most easy to use apps around. Everything is self explanatory. There are lots of great events to pick from.  Everything is organized and  location is automatically set from your phone,What I enjoy least about this app is that not all events happening in the area  are on here. That is about the only thing,,,27-Jun-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,"My overall experience with Eventbrite has been great and I would highly reccomend for others to give it a try. I know that whether it be a corporate or nonprofit, many other organizations have found it to be extremely useful as well.","What I really like about Eventbrite is how easy it is to create events. Whether it be a paid event or a free event, the whole process of creating and listing an event on the site and then getting people to register is an extremely seamless process. I have used Eventbrite to organize one school event and it was great because we were able to get a general idea of how many people we were expecting to show up!","There's definitely not a lot of ways that Eventbrite can get your event a lot of attention unless you share it on social media. For small events, this can be particularly hard to get attention from people that may not be in your immediate network. I think Eventbrite definitely needs to work on how to better improve how events can be promoted.",,,18-Mar-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,5-May,"Overall Eventbrite is a fantastic system -  I used it for about two years to take bookings for a college training restaurant, and the free account did everything we needed, including customised forms for food choices, allergies etc and producing nice readable reports for our chefs and front of house.

Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,,"Eventbrite is very easy to set up and help organize registration for a meeting or conference.  It has lots of functionality and control.  For example, you can set special ticket type, make tickets available or unavailable at specific times/dates, set promo codes for speakers or discounts (e.g. for students).   Payment processing is done by Eventbrite and then transferred electronically to an account you indicate.  Fees are quite low and easily incorporated into ticket price (which you can choose to be visible or not to the end user).  Very intuitive.  You can be up and running in no time.","Eventbrite usually only pays out after your event.  So if you are counting on the money from pre-ticket sales to be in your account prior to event - this is not the right option.  

Reduced pricing for non-profits not available outside USA.",,,2-Nov-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-Mar,"Overall we are extremely satisfied with Eventbrite. Yes, I think their fees are too high, but in terms of actual functionality, Eventbrite pretty much does everything we need it to do extremely well.","Everything Eventbrite does is spectacular. They make it beyond simple to create, manage, take payment, check-in attendees in their app, and receive payment. Even things that seem tricky like adding waivers to tickets and adding custom fields for additional data are extremely simple to use and access. Basically, everything just works as expected.","Now, with great software, I understand does come a price. However while their fee structure has changed over the years, I still maintain they are taking too large a cut of ticket sales. While the exact percentage does change based on your plan and the price of the ticket you're selling, we consistently see 30% or more of our ticket sales revenue go to to Eventbrite. Again I do understand that you do need to pay for great software, I just wish Eventbrite either took a lower percentage or offered a flat fee option.",,,31-Oct-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,,"When you have an event or a cause and you need to get people's attention, you need to get people to come and participate, then Eventbrite is one of the easiest platforms you can use. Not only will your event be posted online, but it will also be easily searchable by google so that if people search for something that your event covers on google then your event can pop up. Better yet, people often go to eventbrite just looking for events to participate in, and when they see your event, they may decide to attend even if they were never even looking for your event.","Eventbrite has access to your contact list, and some people may not be comfortable registering with eventbrite because they don't want their information being too publicly available. In that case you can probably provide multiple options for registering for your event.",,,18-Jul-18

It has been a while since I acquired the app from the apple app store, but I believe it was suggested to download the app to mobile devise to have access to all the cool features.",The software always asks to use your current location.

You get a personalized link to send to everyone via email, or text.",The only con I would say is the website itself needs a update and more color.

Upload images and collects the funds and disperses within 7 days after event ends directly to your account. Can also share your event through some popular social media sites,"What I found to be frustrating is once the event has been published it's hard to edit any photos that may need to be changed. Also if you assign a tag to be directed to a particular audience the tags did not match. I did reach out to CS but they stated it was a tech issue, once transferred to that department I got no response to my concern and the tags hadn't changed.

Eventbrite,5-May,5-Apr,5-Feb,5-May,,Eventbrite has become a highly trusted software and is an industry standard. Eventbrite fulfills the needs of small and large hosts alike and offers a robust way of managing ticket sales and customer information.

I hope they will be able to build on their customer support for hosts as there is no real way to reach the company and/or ask for help.,Very centralized and all-encompassing for selling tickets and hosting events. Fees are higher than usual but may be passed onto buyers. Company/software is trusted and reliable.,"There is almost no direct customer service; you cannot reach a person at Eventbrite and must rely on FAQ pages. There is limited customer support for paying customers, but none for admins and hosts.

I enjoyed how there are referral links/codes to help track ticket sales from other organizations helping us sell tickets.,I did not really have a problem with the software.

Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-Apr,,"Overall Eventbrite is a great way to stay in touch with your community and participate in all sort of events in your area, but you do have to look out for fraud and maybe look more into an event before buying a ticket.","Eventbrite is the easiest way for me to see whats currently going on in my community in regards to social events. I live in the Miami, FL area and it has been a life saver when not knowing where to go with friends. The events are always well described and not too expensive. The app is also extremely easy to use.",My only con for Eventbrite is the fact that it doesn't have a counter for how many people have bought tickets to an events so you don't really know how big an event is til you arrive.

You can find events happening today, tomorrow or within the next month. You can also search for events pretty much where ever you are and are travelling too. I also love that there's free events and very easy to rsvp to them.  The website is very easy to use and everything is clear  to see.  The app is also very easy to use as well.  I haven't created an event on there yet.

There seems to be a good number of folks who are already familiar with this systems which makes things more efficient all around. It won't disappoint!","Easy, easy,  easy! 

I like how it's effortless to create events and send to email contacts. The ability to issue paperless tickets is a huge bonus and you can share across many platforms and has the ability to include direct links to marketing sites. Genius. It also has the ability to print name tags and can track how people found your event. 

On the receiving side, clients are easily able to click and add the event directly into their calendar and tickets are sent electronically.  Would use this everyday if I could.",Dinged a few stars simple because the aesthetic of the templates could use an update. Would like to have a a the ability to add a little more customization.,,,25-May-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,,"My school uses Eventbrite and thus, I sign up for events using this app. It is a simple app and very easy to use. When booking events, the app requests one to enter name, email and the number of people attending. There is no hassle. The booking is then confirmed and one can save the ticket and/or share it on social media. It has great features such as promoting, tracking and checking-in. It also offers a secure online payment option, which is easy to utilize.","Nothing I dislike. As an attendee to many events on campus, I can only talk about the features I have used.

We've never thought of using anything else other than Eventbrite!  They really ARE THEE Industry STANDARD!,"You really have to go through the tutorials to properly use this product so I guess you could say it's not as intuitive as one would hope for.

Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-Apr,"Eventbrite's interface is clean and simple, and figuring out how to customize your event listing is fairly easy. It is also easy to go back in and edit and event. You can export all the registrations into a spreadsheet for easy check in for ticket holders. Eventbrite also helps boost your event because of the search engine optimization and Eventbrite's own tools. Eventbrite will recommend events based on your region or social contacts, thus encouraging more registrations. Yes the service is not free, but it is worth the cost and saves time in terms of registering people and promoting your events.",Eventbrite is very easy to use. It is an easy tool to use to sell tickets and it is pretty straight forward to set up events on Eventbrite and promote them online and via email.,"The cost of using the service could be seen as a downside when there are other ways to sell tickets that are free (minus credit card or paypal fees). You also receive the fee and then pay Eventbrite, as opposed to the fee directly going to Eventbrite when someone buys a ticket.",,,6-Jan-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,,"Not many platforms have incredible functionality for both sides of the house, but Eventbrite is an exception to that.

We can also download our attendee list in order to email them through our email software. There are excellent statistics and information that we can use to compare events and year over year results.","The fees continue to increase, so on some ticketed events we only receive about 65% of the gross sales. The app only shows gross sales, so we have to remember to do the math to see our actual net income.

Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,,5-Apr,5-Apr,,"I used Eventbrite to sell tickets for a business conference. It is pretty easy to use and quick to set up. Payments are based on tickets sold, so you pay only if you sell tickets. Free tickets are not charged. It is possible to create different types of tickets, hide some special tickets (and give a special code to give the access only to some people) and create discount codes. I embedded the ticketing widget on my event website so attendees were able to buy tickets without leaving my site.",The fees applied to the tickets are a bit expensive.

  Lastly ,whenever we create free events on Eventbrite , random interested parties stumble upon these events by accident and book a ticket ,therefore I can say Eventbrite also gives us free adverzement.","Eventbrite limits the level of questions we can ask people to respond to ,before booking tickets for our events.

Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,,,"There are a number of reasons I prefer Eventbrite to other companies. Besides the required 'ease of use' and 'intuitive design' of their site I have to honestly say that I like all the controls the platform gives me. I can easily create different ticket options, discount codes, tracking links, invitations (which also allow me to invite attendees of previous events I've hosted on the platform) and can manually add any users (such as comp tickets for media) to the system without incurring any fees. I can also easily repeat an event with one click, which saves any custom tickets or pricing and also allows for easy updates. Their integration with social media is helpful, and they are always making updates to their offerings. They also have promotional tools to help you reach an audience outside of your usual base. The nonprofit organization I work for has conducted over 70 parties, tours, classes, etc with Eventbrite, and I consider them a partner in helping us produce great events and helping me raise money for our educational programs. I also appreciate that they are growing as a company. I never feel that their 'resting on their laurels' when it comes to the design of the site or the tools offered. Even after working with them for a number of years, I still call tech support to get questions answered if I can't figure it out quickly on my own, and their staff is helpful and nice. All in all I give them an A+. They make my job easier, and I would recommend them to anyone looking for an online ticketing company.",,,,,18-Jul-14

I am thoroughly pleased with this software.,,,20-Dec-19

It is easy to find information and RSVP to events you are invited to, and it allows syncronization with Google Calendars to automatically add the event to your calendar.","As an end user, Eventbrite can be confusing and cumbersome. It also feels archaic and restricted to web. I am unaware of any mobile access or app for the service. It also has a reputation of being very business heavy and does not lend itself to social gatherings outside of business.",,,1-Feb-19

I like that it feels like your getting tickets to something more private in contrast to ticketing software that is so publicly viewed such as Ticketmaster. I like that this is software that any person can use to get work out about their event, it gives it a very ""local"" feel.","Given the nature of the local-feel, if you are simply pointed to the site because you have an event you want to go to and the link to tickets leads you there, its great. But I think as a standalone app, its not an excellent choice for browsing events as a lot of the ones that turn up are not narrowed down by interest as much as other apps in its category.",,,17-Jan-19

That is a pro of the application. Their navigation system of looking for events seems fairly intuitive as well and if one is having a casual browse, the app does well in serving that.","While surfing the application casually can be easy, if one is looking for information in a pinch about an event, it can be a little difficult to find.

Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,,5-Apr,,"Easy to use and plenty of good events to check out. My company also uses the platform to find useful events to go to for Project Management, Marketing or IT events. It is a great team building option and sort of cheap considering many events are free and provide refreshments and snacks. We have also used it to promote our company events and the reach is great, depending on the topics it is even better than social media.","One of the best things about it are the mobile apps, makes everything so much easier. You can just on the bus on the way to work and browse different cool events happening all over town. Very useful if you are looking for place to spend Friday Nights or weekends.

If you have an iPhone, and you choose to attend the event, it will save in your calendar automatically. 
It also syncs up to your maps or Waze for directions.

You've got your professionally designed event page, guests can pay for the event right there, print their tickets, and on the back end there's an abundance of analytics, records, and receipts that I don't have to worry about because it's all there.","This is just a little thing (and might be fixable) but in the event dashboard, when I want to look at past events, I wish it went in the order of most recent event down than first to last.

Eventbrite,5-May,5-Apr,5-May,5-Mar,5-Apr,,"I love the way eventbrite looks. When attendees arrive at the site, they get a very professional presentation. Up until Cvents recent visual update, this was the best looking software in the game. It's also very easy to use. So if your staff are not experienced event planners, it's no problem! They could learn this extremely quickly.","I thought it was the best in the business, but it has a lot less flexibility than Cvent and Regonline. Eventbrite is based off of a ticketing paradigm. Since it's a ticket, some advanced options are not available. One problem we run into is that we apply discount codes. If you apply a 100% discount code (someone gets to attend for free, happens all the time), it will cancel the ticket! So then we as event planners have to go back in and re-register people or have them do it themselves. Customer service doesn't have any great solutions for this problem either.",,,13-Nov-18

Its user interface is very intuitive and allows the creation of a smooth experience for users going through the event registration and ticket purchase process.

I simply love this tool.","I cannot really point out any flaws with this tool's event creation functionality. It does a really great job in that regard, but one thing I do not like is that EventBrite has an event discovery feature, which lists other events listed on Eventbrite.

It makes it easy to not have to print your tickets or look through your email to find them because it's all in one app on your device. I also like that you can sell tickets on there yourself for certain events your business might be having.,What I like least about Eventbrite is that you can't find EVERY event that you're trying to go to on there.

I have nothing but praise for how simple Eventbrite makes the entire event process.,The fact that Eventbrite provides both a landing page and seamless ticket purchasing experience with a free option for non-paid events makes it a must-use tool for non-profit event management. The platform to design the event and set rules and ticket specifications is incredibly simple and having a built-in guest list function is great for managing all the names and +1s for guests. The ability to also collect emails to notify attendees of event information is very useful.,"If you're using Eventbrite for paid ticketing the 3.5% + fees rate can seem a bit hefty, especially if you're passing it along to the consumer to pay for. Unfortunately, this is a reality of buying tickets online where the fees tend to stack up pretty quickly.",,,26-May-19

As a charter school we used this product for two years to promote and gather registrations for our  golf outing and Run/Walk/Bike events.  It did what we wanted but the fees just became too much.

I also love anything that collects data, such as addresses. Use it, for sure!","A few things. It is pretty easy to set up; in fact, it's kind of hard to screw it up! The whole idea of ticket distribution and money collection is taken care of quite nicely. I can also  easily see how many tickets have been purchased, who has purchased, everything that you need in an easy, simple dashboard. I have used it in a variety of settings with never a problem.","Occasionally, creating event posts leads to nowhere. Once or twice, I've had issues with adding in location or editing the description, that sort of thing. Considering the payout and distribution is seamless, it's a pretty small price to be for that.

For instance, I can purchase selected events where I purchased a badge or ticket to attend where ever I go. The software has an option to download tickets and send tickets by email, and it can be saved online. The app of the software is pretty good at check out tickets instantly with my Smartphone. And customer service I used to ask questions really helped me a lot.","There's nothing wrong with using Eventbrite in my computer, but sometimes it needs to be updated a least six times a month for Smartphone users.

We assumed it was a user issue -- that they planned to bring a friend or two but chose not to provide specific names. However, it was actually a system glitch.

Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,5-May,"Overall, I think their service is awesome and handles almost all of the administration for hosting both free and paid events.","Eventbrite is super simple to use, and allows a lot of features even for free events without paying a dime for their service. That said, they handle all invoicing and payments, etc, for a pretty fair fee structure.","They offer reporting on nearly everything, which is great. That said, it's not super intuitively organized, so I've, on multiple occasions, had to search around for specific data points before I found them.",,,14-Dec-18

Some software can be so overly complicated and Eventbrite didn't do that. They gave you everything you needed, for free, in a very intuitive setup.",I did not have any dislikes about this software.

Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,,5-Apr,,Works for what we need it to. I'm excited to see how our customers interact with our upcoming event on Eventbrite!,"I like that Eventbrite is very user friendly. The options are all laid out for you and thought through (such as charging tax, promo codes, etc.). This tool works really well for my company because the event we host annually for our users is less than 100 people, so Eventbrite is an easy, somewhat cheaper option for us.",There aren't many options (at least with the subscription we have) to design the look of the event page. Eventbrite also limits things like number of ticket types you can have depending on your subscription. The reporting tools of past events are a little limited/confusing as well.,,,25-Sep-18

- Seamless user experience
- Safe to use for transactional functions
- Great support with great follow through","This platform is one of the most used event platforms, so the user experience (for ticket buyers) is simple and easy for them. Building your event is easy and enables you to create a launch an event within 10 minutes. It's great to use for small sized events, but for larger events the payout process can become a pain.  It has great widget items that you can embed like a countdown clock or ticket buyer.","The new embed feature they use is not compatible with all CMS. If your CMS does not work well with iFrames, you'll have to do 4 extra steps in the creation process in order to use the classic embed code. The map of where the event is located can be glitchy and not show up at all. If you're using the free version, you payout is sent after you event has occurred unless you can have support change it without a fee. There isn't an Eventbrite Wordpress plugin, which would be great as well.",,,9-Jul-18

Having contact information on file and one-click emailing makes it way easier for people to get in communication with me if there are any queries,I cannot think of any negatives for eventbrite except that advertising is kind of little expensive for every ticket as there is % + per ticket sold price + credit card processing fee which makes it to about 20% but it is worth it for the advertising we get,,,27-Jun-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,Cost Value - Their cost is spot on and its one of the best event registration and marketing tools out there.,"This sophisticated event marketing and registration tool is easy to use and track attendees.  In addition, Eventbrite will help you collect money for registration, register people at the door and market your event to the public.",I wish Eventbrite would take their money from the payments directly vs the user having to return after an event and pay the final bill.

Their seller interface is straightforward and easy to use, and their mobile compatibility for iOS and Android  work well for selling tickets on a mobile device. I was quite happy with how easy it was for someone to buy tickets on a mobile device.

Their platform integrates well with websites as well, and at least when we used Eventbrite you could add an Eventbrite widget to the event's website and sell tickets natively on the event's website.","Eventbrite's service fees, etc. are, in my opinion, a little steep to make sense for most small events. They do provide a lot of value in streamlining the ticket-buying experience for a guest, so it may be worth it.

I would really like to see some upgrades made so that information reflects accurate event details, but other than that I would say that it is a great platform to use!!","I like that it makes it easy to purchase tickets for events (and get information about the event) all in one place! It is very convenient and straightforward, which is nice!!","Sometimes the platform glitches, which can make it hard to get updates about event changes that have been made.

Eventbrite,5-Mar,5-Mar,,5-Mar,,"As a business solution, I find Eventbrite to be less than ideal.  It's simply not seamless ... such as Ticketmaster would be for personal use.  On a personal level,  I purchased tickets for a concert that was delayed because of the Corona crisis.  Upon purchase, the tickets were ""owned"" by Eventbrite, yet I never received a single notification from Eventbrite.  This was particularly annoying when I went to the concert (pre-quarantine days), only to learn that the concert had been postponed.  Eventbrite NEVER sent an update or notification, nor did it offer a solution moving forward.","I find very little about the product to be useful.  Somehow, EventBrite has inserted itself as some sort of Ticketmaster for millennials despite providing a limited value add.","My biggest beef with Evenbrite is its inability to effectively manage event tickets purchased for personal use vis-a-vis tickets purchased for business purposes.  In the version I was using, it was nigh impossible to toggle between personal and business tickets. Mind you, the user has little or no choice when it comes to the 3rd party entity who ""owns"" the actual ticket. I'm disappointed that Eventbrite has not yet addressed this as a product feature.",,,29-Apr-20

But better than some other organizations and companies and how they alert you to potential anything.,I am on the receiving end of Eventbrite and love it. It is an excellent source of information delivered straight to me for potential gigs and overall related job opportunities.  They email me the leads and needs and do so off of my interest profile. I have nothing to pay and a lot to gain.,"While I enjoy getting pointed in certain directions I often find that what I am seeking is not always what I am being solicited on or rather what I am getting suggestions about related to my interested job opportunities.  This is rare so it keeps me on my toes and it adds to similar companies that help keep me going, keep me aware and at times keep me employed or invested.

It's really hard trying to find things by word of mouth because sometimes the information is wrong and then you finally arrive you see that you had to pay before hand.,What I do like least about Eventbrite is that the locations that I put in for the events I want to know about it gives me events that are 50 miles away from me. Maybe that's a mistake on my part and I need to change the parameters.,,,14-Dec-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-Apr,,5-May,,Eventbrite makes it easy to buy tickets to any type of event. You can buy a lot of tickets at a time or send events to your friends so they can purchase tickets too. i am sure it would also be super helpful to have this as the maker of an event.,"I like a lot of the things that Eventbrite can do. I have used it for buying event tickets such as concerts, meet-ups, dinners, and even small local events. One of the best features when it comes to concert tickets is that it shows all the seat types and locations, so you know where you will be from the stage. It lets you buy cheaper seats or nicer ones for more. It's also nice even for free events because it lets the event creator know you are coming.","Sometimes with Eventbrite the payment process can be difficult.

It's been great for the free events I am setting up for a client.","It is fairly easy to use and set up, especially once you've done it a couple of times. I feel like consumers are familiar with it, so there's a level of trust there also. Additionally, I love that there is no fee to use Eventbrite for free events.","For some of the more ""advanced"" settings (creating private events, etc.) and when I needed to cancel an event, it took a little research to figure out what to do. There are plenty of online resources, but there were a couple of aspects that could be a little more intuitive.",,,18-Sep-19

Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,,5-Apr,,"I have used Eventbrite several times in responding to events I was invited to. It can be a good way to keep people in the loop and keep track of RSVPs, but I think the same thing can be done by making a Facebook event page. In the case that the people you are inviting do not use Facebook, then this is probably the most popular alternative.","Makes it easy to create an event, publicize it to potential guests, and receive responses via email.",The number of emails that you may receive can be very overwhelming and annoying.,,,16-Aug-19

Really nice experience overall.,"I have registered for several conferences using EventBrite and I found it especially easy to use.  Often conference registration is really cumbersome, asks for too many details and has too many pages.  EventBrite seems to only ask for just the basics which is fine by me.  I get a ticket on my phone and then that's it - I just pull it up when I arrive at the event.  I don't have to print anything out beforehand - I just show up and show the ticket on my phone.  Very easy experience.",I can't think of anything.  As a registrant I am always happy to see that it is the software being used.,,,13-Jul-19

The Eventbrite softwate helps me get an idea of the event turnout even prior to the event through rsvps/tickets sold, which in turn helps me prep to host/serve a number guests accordingly.

For no-fee events it is great.,"The fees for paid events are more than other competitors. Since I generally use this for non-profits, this can be an issue",Brown Paper Tickets,,18-Jul-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,5-May,"I have used this over the last 5 years for our annual events in our company. I love that I can use it free of charge, I can email everyone to invite them , and it will update me and track who has responded and who hasn't. I also like the feature that allows you to limit the number of guests they are allowed to bring with them, and can be set to zero if it is a staff only function.",There are many selections to choose from when using it FREE.,The better quality selections are ones that cost.,,,18-Apr-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,,"Does everything I would need for buying tickets to shows and events that I want to attend. Pretty straightforward sign-up and archiving events, as well as accessing my tickets. Used for most events I go to, so it is convenient.",Could be better at recommending concerts and events I would actually want to attend. Their browse and suggestions don't always align with my interests.,,,29-Mar-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,5-May,,Eventbrite is easy to navigate from both the event planner and attendee's perspectives. The fees are also minimal for ticket purchases. The mobile app enables event goers to easily manage their schedules and tickets.,"Eventbrite is best for simple events. I would not recommend it for use in complicated events, such as conferences with multiple simultaneous sessions.",,,10-Feb-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,"Try and verify who the tickets are for, in the case they are changing the person attending event allow for easier change. No single person needs 6 tickets to anything, period.",I use this several times a year to purchase. It's very straight forward and you don't have to worry about discrepancy in prices. I have mainly used this to purchase concert tickets and I usually see that the ticket prices stay stationary rather than fluctuating like other ticket or even websites. 10/10 recommend.,Something Eventbrite along with most other event ticket selling platforms should really work on is the emphasis they should place on people who are ordering a LOT of tickets at once. There tends to be a clear trend in scalping tickets especially for events in small venues.,,,24-Jan-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,Overall my experience with Eventbrite has been excellent. I am able to find and purchase tickets for ALMOST every show i go to PLUS my friends who throw events use them.,I use Eventbrite for any and all shows i attend in my city and it is all i use. Not only do i find it better then Ticketmaster i feel like the service fees are less as well.,I have absolutely nothing bad to say against Eventbrite. I have used this site for years and have yet to run into issues.,,,31-Dec-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,"This is the simplest of software for both setting up a meeting and reviewing a meeting invite.  You have the ability to review the content of the meeting, the venue, date and time.  Once accepted, it's one click to download to your calendar; Outlook, google, etc.","Great for reviewing a meeting content, date and time.  Takes minutes to both set up and respond to a new meeting and venue.",I cannot really think of a downside to this software.  It truly takes minutes to use.,,,19-Dec-18

Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,,We almost always use Eventbrite for planning events because it is easy for us and easy for our participants when they register to attend.  The fees are reasonable and we've never had a problem.,"At first, we found it a little difficult to link Eventbrite to some of the other software we use, including our website, so that people could go to one place for registering.  Eventually, we got the hang of it, and now there's no problems at all.",,,4-Dec-18
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Feb,5-Feb,5-Mar,5-Mar,Overall I like the idea of Eventbrite and it somehow works decent enough. (at the side of customers buying tickets the site is perfect and you'll have your tickets immediatly in your mailbox after paying). But from a seller's perspective I think they could've done a way better job at making it simple and easy to use.,"I like the fact that you can just set-up an event if you're organising one. Everyone can sell tickets for their events and that's a good thing, makes your event available to a large audience so you could probably get more visitors by putting it on a website like Eventbrite.",When you are selling tickets you will have some trouble solving everything. I remember having a lot of trouble with changing events and the available tickets. Had to wait a long time to get a response from their support aswell.,,,26-Nov-18
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-Apr,"Overall, Eventbrite is an easy tool and fun to use. It makes finding, attending and planning events simpole and enjoyable.","It is easy to organize an event and invite others in a timely and accurate matter. Also, finding events to attend or join is easy with this tool, which is especially important for those owning small businesses and need to make their presence known in the community.",I have no complaints with this software.,,,19-Nov-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-Mar,5-Apr,Eventbrite has been a great tool for selling tickets. I like that you can send email notifications to all or just a portion of your registrants. You can easily keep track of tickets sold and manipulate those controls. And I like the analytics that help you know who is buying and when. Great product.,I like Eventbrite b/c of the way it integrates with social media. I can set up my facebook event page and have the option for people to buy tickets right there without having to be re-directed back to eventbrite. That is super helpful and makes us look really professional.,"I don't like that you can't really customize your event page. I think that was a recent change b/c you used to be able to manipulate colors and fonts for the page, but now the colors automatically generate based on your event header image.",,,3-Nov-18
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-May,5-Apr,,Eventbrite is a convenient interface for attendees to view event information and register for events. It's also easy to cancel registrations and access a list of attendees.,"The skin/theming isn't as customizable as I would like for it to be, in order to match the theming on event pages. I would also like more options to be able to frame just the registration section instead of the full page; Eventbrite has decreased the framing/sharing options in recent years.",,,4-Sep-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-Apr,5-May,5-May,,"I have been using Eventbrite for several years. It is very user-friendly. Anyone can figure it out. You can manage rsvps, updates, pricing/location info, etc. It also keeps a history of your past events.","Not much that I don't like. I've used other event planning apps/software, but I still like Eventbrite. Maybe they could eliminate or extend the timer that they place on the screen to finish your order before the tickets go back in the pool.",,,1-Aug-18
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-May,,"If you want to create a cool invite that reaches everyone who has email, and uses graphics that are fun this is an easy way to do that. Not everyone uses Facebook, so an invite here is better sometimes.","With all freebie software platforms there are advertisements, it's just annoying sometimes frankly. Also, it would be great if a snail mail option with postal purchasing built in was included. Some people still don't respond or get (believe it or not!) email.",,,1-Aug-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-Mar,5-Apr,5-Apr,,I never had any issues using it. The UI/UX is quite clear and havent noticed anything that would stop me from using it. Other than that its up to the creator if he will make the event on facebook eventbrite etc.,"There isnt really any incentive to use it. I get annoyed that I have to retype things from my account a lot of times but its kinda irrelevant. If someone wants me to sign up through it, I will but thats it.",,,8-May-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-Apr,You can organize and sell your tickets for your next conference or class.,"Is beautiful to use. Eventbrite is very well designed, so it is very useful to understand how the things work. The best of Eventbrite is that is free when your event is free! So when I'm organizing a free conversation or conference i know Eventbrite is the best solution to distribute my entrance tickets. Even when is a paid event, Eventbrite only takes the 6% as a commission for the sell and it give me an event page to promote the event and an app to control the sales.","It could be amazing if Eventbrite implements more payment methods (I know you can use Debit and credit cards), that could be useful in no banked countries. Sometimes people prefers to go and pay physically what they buys.",,,4-May-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,,"We've never hosted an event, but have been on the ""guest"" end several times and each time we use Eventbrite, we can rest at ease knowing our bases are already covered and we don't have to worry about printing, remembering, or picking up any physical tickets. Makes attending the event so much easier to have everything in one place.","We're really happy this app exists, though again we can't speak to the ""hosting"" side of using the app.",,,18-Mar-18
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,,5-Apr,,,"Working with various events I have enjoyed my experience with eventbrite. Really easy to use for customers, will help you track and keep your event organized without worry.  The positives are lots of features, options for collecting payments, reporting, notifications, and use of app. It works great!",Their service fees are on the higher side. Would like to see more options for templates (use for promotion) which better fit what we're going for per event.,,,11-Feb-18

Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,It's a great platform and the one to use if you are often booking events.,It has a beautiful UX that is very professional looking and legit. When people think of event sign-ups they think of eventbrite. What else do people even use? They are the best in the game.,I feel like the prices keep getting higher and higher to use the platform. They are great but hate losing 2% of transactions.,,,8-Nov-20
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,Used it for years for various events of both small and large size.,Useful for tracking both small and large numbers of events.  Been great for using as invites and check ins for events especially with COVID restrictions in place,Not everyone has been able to use the check in option.  It doesn't work without an internet connection for checkin which makes some remote locations a little iffy.,,,22-Oct-20
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,"For industry events, it's been good to use this for registration.",I have used this program many times when registering for industry events. The registration process has been easy and it keeps track of where/when the event is being held.,"Nothing comes to mind as a deal breaker when using this program. Oftentimes, there isn't an option (to use something else) when registering for an event.",,,13-Oct-20
Eventbrite,5-May,5-Mar,,5-Apr,,I use the software weekly to find events local to me and it's been great in finding local and virtual events,I like how easy it makes finding local and virtual networking events for business and also for personal,More so of an admin poster issue but sometimes closed events will be posted and you won't know that they are member only events until actually joining,,,28-Sep-20
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,"Overall, Eventbrite is a great and simple to use tool to organize and attend events.",My favorite feature is the Eventbrite's ability to integrate with a multitude of different devices making it super easy to find and use when it's time to attend an event.,In order to find the event you're looking for you either need to know the specific name of the event or it could be hard to locate going through the directory.,,,15-Sep-20

It has not given me any problem since i started using it, but it is good some more features are added to make it easier to share events. There is definitely room for improvement.",,,18-Jun-20
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Mar,,5-May,,"Good experience overall. It took me a little while to confidently set-up an event with eventbrite.=, repeat events were very easy to set-up.",I used eventbrite for a few repeat events we were hosting. I really like the ability to replicate past events and edit details.,It was a little confusing to set-up the first time around. I didn't find the help page very helpful and googled answers to my questions.,,,9-Jun-20
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,"Absolutely great, we use this for all events we host!",I loved using eventbrite for events we hosted! it was easy to set everything up and share our event through the site.

It's great as it fills the need and at a great cost to the team.,,,28-Apr-20
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,"Sometimes the best thing is staying simple, but staying simple is very difficult many times.

In the beginning, many people did not know it, but now it is a very well-known app.",,,5-Apr-20
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,Eventbrite is a fantastic tool for planning events and managing attendees/constituents. A free resource with so much planning/organizational power is a no-brainer and SO valuable to our organization.,I love the simplicity of the tool and the features. The invitation design is also a huge plus.,The ads and the paid designs are great but I wish the tool was completely free. But I understand the company needing to make a profit.,,,12-Mar-20
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,Eventbrite gives several event suggestions forevents I may be interested in based on the events I have attended which is a great social tool. There wide variety of event hsted on this platform makes it a powerful tool for planning fun nights out in the city.,"I like that many companies use this software to launch/organize their event ticketing. You can integrate it with your Google Calendar, and get real notifications on the events you sign up for. It is a veru intuitive software which makes it very easy to use.","The search function on the mobile app can be a little laggy and a little counterintuitive. I thik getting pop-up or notifications with new events around your area would be great. Now, you are the one that has to go into the app and look for something.",,,10-Dec-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,5-May,Many of our staff has enjoyed free trainings registered via eventbrite. We have been able to network and gain new clients too,"I have been priviledged to attend life/business saving trainings related to my industry, some free and some paid for.  This guys has done a great job giving us a platform where we can search through useful events and pick and chose which to attend.","The search feature isn't so great. Having to type in all data for payment is exhausting.  Haven't been able to process refunds for events that failed to hold, I think you guys need to hold funds in escrow until events are confirmed to hold, so that refunds will be processed trough eventbrite and not organizers",,,9-Dec-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-Apr,,5-May,,Nothing but all positive experiences every time I've used it,I am able to find great events where I live and when I travel easily through the app. Also it stores all of your tickets under your account so need to waste ink by printing!,"There is absolutely nothing that I like least about this app/website, everything is truly awesome.

Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-Mar,5-Apr,,"Mine experience has been somewhat positive, and as someone in the tech industry I can say the interface and user experience is quite well. However, based on the poor customer experience received by a few of my close friends, I would choose to avoid Eventbrite when I can.","Easy to navigate interface, and can easily find events nearby in a timely fashion. Choosing seats and ticket options is an overall positive experience through this software.","Typically I would do my best to avoid purchasing from Eventbrite if I can. This is mainly based on hearing poor experiences from some peers and coworkers. Generally, the feedback is about poor customer service and in some cases been victim of scams which were left unresolved by the Eventbrite team. Personally, the Eventbrite interface is easy to use, and tickets and events are easily navigated. However, would choose Ticketmaster as my primary place to purchase.",,,22-Oct-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-Mar,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-Apr,It is something that is meant to make life easier but yet it requires too many steps.,"The easiness of remembering my details is good, also that it integrates with calendars although this may be troublesome with ical.",The notes when it asks to integrate with calendars are not explicit enough. it should also work more smoothly with siri commands if it works at all.,,,24-Sep-19

Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-May,,5-Mar,,I have RSVP'd to many events using Eventbrite and even bought tickets thru EventBrite. The ticket buying process isn't as seamless as the rest of the functionality of the site but overall it works good and is easy and quick to use.  The best part is the auto reminders that it sends before the event and you can also have it import the event into your personal calendar which is super convenient. Definitely would recommend this software,"It's easy to use as a user. Just a few clicks and you can respond whether or not you are going to an event.

I also love that you can connect it with facebook thus giving me access to my friend list. You can also create coupon codes and much more.","I would say the fee is a little higher than I would like to pay for this software.

With Eventbrite you can skip all of these custom and expensive steps and save thousands of dollars.,"There aren't many negative things to say about Eventbrite but if I had to think of something, it would be customer support.

Eventbrite,5-May,5-Apr,,5-Apr,,The platform allows you to track your event progress. You can set ticket sale limits and see how many tickets are currently sold which is a nice feature.,Eventbrite is pretty user-friendly and allows you to easily create events. You can upload an event photo and easily promote your event on social media. The interface looks clean and professional.,"Because the interface is relatively simple and straightforward you are limited in some aspects. For example, you event title can't be too long and the event photo is cropped to certain dimension; so there are some limitations in customizing.",,,23-Oct-18

Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-Apr,5-May,5-Apr,"Helps with overall marketing of our events. It saves enormous amount of time and to have everything from one platform to extend into the rest is really a great tool in hand. 

We save staff, money and time with this software and we are available on more newsplatforms for events at the same time.","This software just connects everything needed. Build the event on one platform and share it, extend it to all imaginable platforms. The integrations level and functionality is stunning and well thought through.","Id be missing functions to drag and drop content to the standard editor. It has html but a more intuitive userinterface Id prefer . As well the ability to make different text styles in the newsletters and on site.

Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-May,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-Apr,Good overall experience with Eventbrite,"I love the integration between the desktop and the mobile app. Also, I have found that the community sense on eventbrite is better than other similar tools. The potential event matching capabilities of Eventbrite are better and I constantly find myself aligned with the recommended events that are published on the site.",If eventbrite could be integrated into an existing social media platform then it would be easier to track events through that integration as currently they have to be tracked seperately.,,,8-Sep-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,,"I like the fact that you can send an invitation via email or other ways of communication over paper.

Never running out of options for things to do on the weekend.","This website has existed for 12 years but my girlfriend and I just found out about this a few months ago. She has lived in Dallas, TX her whole life and I have lived here for about 5 years now. We THOUGHT that we had done everything there was to do in Dallas, but after finding Eventbrite we realized we were very wrong. This website is really unique and easy to use and is truly a killer of boredom.","The only thing that I can think of that is a con of this software is that you can't ask questions about the events online. I think the site would greatly benefit from some type of forum for each event where people could ask questions and have someone who knows about the event answer them. My girlfriend and I have found ourselves wondering things like what kind of clothes to wear or what seating would be like with many events, and have not been able to get those questions answered.",,,1-Aug-18

Creating events within the platform is very simple, you are guided step by step, and everything can be changed at any time, the general graphics greatly enhances the offers and opportunities available. It is a fantastic tool to discover some very cool event in any city.","The only thing that I found problematic, is that not always Eventbrite gives you a feedback about the participation to an event, it might tell you that you can still purchase a ticket while they are already sold out, but it happened to me only one time out of many times.",,,2-Jul-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,Protect my financial information,I have always had an easy time responding to events on this software. I like that I am providing them with my information instead of the host when it is hosted by a group I am not familiar with,I have heard their fees are high in comparison to their competition.

Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-Apr,5-May,5-Apr,,"I first used Eventbrite as a way to gather assistants for a promotional event. It made keeping track of the RSVPs and attendees so simple! I was able to export excel sheets with every person who confirmed they would assist, plus the fact that the reminders are sent out automatically and (at least) a paper ticket can be requested for the person to show on their phones or download them, makes them remember about the event even more. When you host a free event it is possible for a lot of people to forget about it or disregard it more easily, but when they have to take the time to download the ticket and so forth, it is more of a commitment. The add to calendar feature is also very very handy.","Not sure if this is offered (it sure must be), but a pay option with no Eventbrite branding would be perfect and if I use it again I would be glad to purchase it.",,,8-May-18

The ticketing websites that were made available to the multitude of localities was at best just plainly underdeveloped.  It was incredible to see that with the technology available during this day and age, something that was akin to sophomoric ticketing.  For example, the site's availability to obtain tickets, was limited to just one time slot during a weekly period in the state's various counties.  Logging into the site was almost immediately blocked due to the immense number of login attempts.  This was further complicated when one actually was able to log in, and find themselves getting into the ""ticket"" mode.  To me, and to anyone that has ever purchased any type of tickets, this would have meant that a ""ticket"" was available.  But this was only the beginning of the frustration.  Clicking he ""ticket"" entry only took you to a selection of some 10-15 time slots that were almost immediately shown as:  ""Event Currently Unavailable"".  However, this is NOT the end.  Clicking on that particular message 10 -100 times (or maybe more), only took to to either a repeat of that same message, or to a blank disconnect screen, or to another message that showed that the event was ""Sold Out"".",The software appears to be very popular for selling event tickets online.

Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,,It's a super easy way to list an event and collect attendee numbers and details. I've run several events and it worked great for this.

This has made it tricky for me to co-run events with others. 

There's a bit of a visibility gap about event organisers - I wanted to be updated of new events by organisers whose events I wanted to follow, but couldn't see any option. 

Event finding also lags behind Facebook, for example, and seems to be very much the mainstream, paid-event crowd.

Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-May,,5-Apr,,,It was easy to install and setting up events is very easy.  Applicants reported no problems registering and reminders were sent in a timely manner.,It is not the most professional looking site.  They also tend to send a lot of promotional e-mail.,,,12-Jun-19

Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-May,5-Mar,,"Overall, I think Eventbrite is useful. Lower fees than AXS and ticketmaster, and easy to use for smaller clubs and music venues.",Eventbrite is a super easy and user friendly ticketing system. Everything on their site is very straightforward and easy to navigate.,"I don't like that the gross number on the auto reports that get sent out include fees-- that number isn't useful when it comes to sending net and gross over to ticketing agents.

I don't like that you can't see more than one venue at a time-- you have to specifically go back into the manage panel to select another show at another venue.",,,17-May-19
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,,5-Apr,,,"Just like the name, it's a one stop shop for any event or gathering, very easy to use and doesn't need any extra tutorial for those that would be registering for events using it. I also like the fact that you can program it to your taste and needs like when you have to send reminders to participant of your events. I've been using Eventbrite for the last 2years for my event and I've not had any regrets.","You only do not have to pay when your event is free but it's not bad anyways. Also the timing for each registration, some first timers  might not really get the whole concept at first usage.",,,8-May-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,I have been using EventBrite for over 7 years and love its ability to sell tickets to events for my companies and organizations.,EventBrite is user-friendly. Easy to set up events and link them to your website. I Love the new Facebook Addin which allows your guests to buy tickets right from the Facebook event without having to be connected to another landing page or external site.,"EventBrite is limited in the marketing aspect. It is great that you can sell tickets on this platform and they have made leaps and bounds with integration for Facebook and MailChimp but if you are looking for a one-stop shop, this may not be for you.",,,3-May-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,5-May,Easy to use and easy to get users to download and quickly interact.,"Introduced to this software through a county health department, using it for an event. Really helpful in getting responses and in making the event visible, and for tracking the participants.","There seem to be many of these types of apps, so I'm not sure how it ranks in being recognizable.

Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-Apr,5-May,,I have a very positive experience working with Eventbrite. I used it when working on migrating content for numerous university clubs. We had to create different levels of membership and tickets with promo codes varying depending on person's levels of memberships. Eventbrite is very flexible in what you can achieve.,"Eventbrite allows to easily create single or recurrent events and payments (such as membership fees, etc.)  and add a variety of tickets available for different prices and  conditions, to generate promo  codes. It also generates reports that allow to see the  progress of sales. Also it gives an ample opportunity to apply custom design to the event and has user-friendly forms that allow to enter event's location, date, and other details.","When the company I was contracting for used Eventbrite, not all countries'  currency was supported (we needed to setup events from within US, so some of the countries had to provide alternative method of receiving payment).",,,7-Feb-19

Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-Apr,,"I work for a University and a lot of our events are free and use Eventbrite and it's always a seamless experience. You can also save the tickets as cards on my iPhone, which is very convenient.","One of the things I really liked was that even if the event was free, Eventbrite was seamless, just as if you had paid for a ticket. 

You can even use the site to look for events, sort of like a search tool for events in your area. You can also create events on the website for others to register for.","I don't like that in order to create a login, I had to use a service like LinkedIn to login with. I feel that it would be nice to be able to create a login specific to Eventbrite.",,,28-Nov-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,5-May,"Eventbrite is used for our networking events and launch events. It's been quite a friendly tool for the consumers, making it easy for us to invite others, charge, or even offer free one time promo codes. It's pretty vital for hosting an event.

Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-May,5-Apr,5-Apr,,I like how easy it is to use and set up your events. We used this software to advertise our job fair events. This software allows us to send mass communication to applicants in our ATS informing them about our event and asking them to RSVP for it. It has made the events easier to manage because it gives us an idea of how many candidates we can expect to attend by allowing them to select time slots.,"The only thing I do not like is that it allows our applicants the ability to select multiple time slots for our events. It would make more sense to only allow them to select one time slot. Allowing the candidate to select multiple times with multiple tickets has inflated some of our numbers, which can be misleading because we think more candidates are going to attend than actually will.",,,27-Sep-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-Apr,5-May,5-Apr,5-May,"I've used Eventbrite on a couple of occasions. Each time to secure tickets for an event. I was able to reserve many many tickets very easily.

There are upsells, but they don't get in the way of small, personal use.",,,11-Sep-18
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-May,5-Mar,5-Apr,,,I really like how Eventbrite includes all the details to whatever the occasion may be. I also like how Eventbrite asks if you want to add it directly to your calendar and then does so with permission...along with all the details.,"As much as the reminders are nice...I don't like how many reminders they give you. It also automatically alerts you of events in your area. To unsubscribe from this option, you have to do that at the bottom of the email and then follow a link.",,,16-Aug-18
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-May,5-Mar,5-Apr,5-Apr,,"They are kind of like Stubhub in the sense that they have accumulated a very wide, impressive range of events. The layout is also sharp and simple.

Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,,Eventbrite is a free/low cost solution to event promotion and management. It has a ton of great features like Facebook event integration and mailchimp integration that are easy to use.,"Tough one... I have had such a good experience using Eventbrite. Perhaps the only negative is that when integrating with a free Facebook event there is no way to change the name of the button from ""Purchase Tickets"" which created confusion. I wish we could have used RSVP or something similar.",,,13-Jun-18

A great third party tool for events that require a higher level of brand image without having to invest a lot in a proprietary system.,"It can get expensive as the size of your event grows, so it requires some research. There isn't much flexibility built into the pricing model.",,,7-Jun-18
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,,5-Apr,,,Easy way to get out the word when the team is having an event and getting people to RSVP. It sends reminders out too before the event if they haven't RSVP'd.,"Nothing really, it's a pretty straightforward product for what it is. I don't really like all the emails they send me advertising various different things, but all companies do that.",,,6-Jun-18
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-Apr,N/A,We use this to sign up for monthly trainings at work. We are required to complete 3-4 continuing education classes each month and Eventbrite does a good job with it.  You can view everything on one page along with dates and times that fit into your schedule.,The one thing I don't like at all is once you select a specific training you have to go back to the very beginning and start all over to select another one. That is very annoying.,,,31-May-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-Apr,5-May,"Eventbrite is one of the important tool to register yourself for any event and the team working behind the screens are really enthusiastic at managing stuffs, and events, making it a memorable experience and user-friendliness makes life easy.","Being a Student at UNLV, Nevada, where Most of the time Events and festivals take place, and I have trusted this company to get the tickets for the events,
It is very user-friendly that a KG Kid can easily print a ticket for him/herself. The whole Process usually takes place in  three steps and It also gives an access to mark it on your calendar so you don' miss it anyhow and you promptly get an e-mail regarding your registration and E-ticket.",Add-ins for invited guests and users can make the process more efficient and convenient and it can also be used to avoid the rush at the event itself.,,,8-May-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,5-May,,"Keep track of all of your attendees in one place!  Collect funds, contact attendees, with added (paid) features like printing name tags.",Extras that would be helpful such as printing name tags are integrated with third party sites that will charge for their services.

It seems pretty easy to navigate.","I don't like the extra fees that are tacked on, it's a little annoying to think you are paying one price and then it bumps up because of an extra fee.  But it does seem like it shows the fee before moving forward too much in the process, so that part is decent, even though having the fees is still inconvenient.",,,5-Apr-18

Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-Apr,,"For the registrant the process is seamless, however, Eventbrite could improve their backend experience for those putting on the event. For example, not all event hosts have the digital capability to scan everyone's ticket.  It would be helpful to non-profits or organizations who are boot strapping to more easily be able to download an excel sheet of attendees, or load names directly to a name badge template.",,,,,15-Mar-17
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-Mar,5-Apr,5-May,I used it for a last minute event to broadcast the event,"Ease of use for customers to ""buy"" tickets, list events and different types of entry , because it is widely used I was able to get my message out easily,","Limits on notification scheme , found it difficult to update after I had already created the event.

Eventbrite,5-Feb,5-Feb,5-Jan,5-Feb,,I use it because many of the events I attend use it by default.,"I like that I can find a huge variety of events in one place. Once I am logged in to my account, the registration process is faily simple.","I am not able to automatically sync the events I am signed up for with my Google calendar.  I have to enter each event individually. Moreover, if I sign up for something using my iphone, there is no option to enter the event directly to my google calendar. I have to type it in every time. 

One more thing which is frustrating is that when I have finished registering for an event, the ticket pops up 3 or 4 times, again and again and again.

The event suggestion is very much off from what I typically look at. And surprisingly, I am often not even able to see the people or organizations I follow, let alone their events.",,,17-Sep-20

Eventbrite allows users put all the information up  online as well as connect their emails. It also makes tracking people. Eventbrite also allows set reminder emails.,What I least like about the software is the buying table. In the past a customer and event creator I have struggled to  buy large tickets amount. Minor glitches in the app had many customers complain they could not put the credit card information. Glitches with ao sometimes gives us wrong reads with on the amount checked in.,,,5-Apr-20

It's easy to set up, reliable, and from a user pov, people are very familiar with its interface. It allows you to keep multiple events organized in one place , and its mobile implementation is better than most similar pieces of software that I've seen.","It would be nice to have a bit more flexibility re: how your event appears on the event page. I guess it's the trade off you pay for ease of use, but having 2 or 3 design options would be nice.

Extremely scaleable: you can plan out a personal event for free, or creat events for largd scale opperations. The software includes ticketing options as well, so it can be the single program you use to reach your audience , ticket them, and collect market demographics from your participants.","Can get confusing with large scale operations, and while the ticketing software is useful, it is not the most glamorous; other operatios devoted completely to ticketing can be more effective.",,,18-Jul-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-Apr,5-May,5-Apr,,"We have only used Eventbrite and no other system - its super easy to set up, keep track and so forth...no switching here!","Great way to keep track (especially when space/seating is limited), knowing who is RSVP to events and so forth.",I personally haven't found any draw back with this system,,,1-Jul-19

Lots of events are being posted through Eventbrite hence lots of choices for attendees and event organizers. Their registering system is seamless. Creating an event is also extremely easy.,"Although free for free events, pricing can be a bit high for low priced tickets, hence you need to consider price when setting the overall price of the ticket. 
The main page when searching for events on the web does not contain the filter option. You need to perform another action in order to get to filters.",,,21-Jun-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-Apr,We use Eventbrite for ticketing of academic conferences and managing registrations for these events.,"Eventbrite really is the bog standard for ticketing and events. It's very flexible and you can customize things like early access, waiting lists, referrals, etc. without having to read through a 1000 page manual. The uptime has been fantastic and we've never encountered a crash due to servers being overloaded. The newly designed mobile app is a big improvement and participants can exchange contact details, upload slides and documents, and register for sessions at the event (conference style).",A bit pricey compared to competitors but in my opinion Eventbrite is worth the costs as the functionality simply can't be beat in other companies' products.,,,14-Jun-19

They roped us in the first year we worked with them by assigning us a an actual representative, but that quickly changed.",It feels choppy because each event has to stand alone. They don't necessarily link together as one large event if you are trying to build out separate events for each day or time. Horrible customer service over time. We finally started to pay for their equipment and they didn't answer their phones or emails during our event at all. They also sent equipment that is not compatible by most standards to modern day technology or building codes. They did not seem to care about the aftermath of losing money for our event.,,,25-Apr-19

It was extremely easy to keep track of all the orders and create promotional codes.",I would say the least user-friendly feature I found in Eventbrite was that it wasn't that easy to collaborate with the rest of the team.

Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-May,,5-May,,,My school uses this for events where the attendance is limited. This is a great way to get RSVPs that can be rescinded and given to others if the original person is unable to attend.

They have a lot of wonderful templates that you can use to add a little flair to your flyer","As mentioned in my title, I used this for both business and personal and lets just say a lot of business professionals were invited to my a baby shower.

I love being able to browse events nearby by category or mood!","(This may be a feature I'm not aware of or that my university perhaps did not utilize, but) while attempting to register for some of my university events, I missed the brief window where tickets became available and was not able to attend because they were sold out.

I would also assume it helps our HR department keep track of what employees are going to what company events.,"One time I could not remember whether or not I had received my tickets for an event. So, I just went in and got two more. It turns out that I had already applied for the event, and then I had four tickets to the event. The point being, that could throw off numbers for HR.

We do a lot of free events, but some paid, so the fact that it's super easy to switch between the two is great. I also love people can purchase tickets through Facebook Event pages via Eventbrite. We've also had several people come to our event just because they were searching the eventbrite site. So that's an awesome bonus.","It's super easy to use. It's very intuitive. I'm using the newer version as well, which really streamlines setting up an event. And I love how we can charge for an event if we want, and let's us easily decide whether we want to eat the fees/taxes, or pass on the customer.","Setting up bank accounts is sort of confusing.

It is also public information so it can easily be sent to other to hear feedback about participating before and purchasing needs to take place. It is easy to finalize orders as well.","Probably because of uncontrollable reasons, that are a lot of events that do not appear on Eventbrite. Purchasing tickets to an event to later find out that there is a better one that you did not see on there can be frustrating.

If you don't have the technical know how to build your own registration website and database eventbrite is a great solution. Their infrastructure has allowed our events (both free and paid) to function quite well. Integration with mail chimp was also very useful,"The one size fits all approach that they have works for the most part, however when organizing an event with several tracks and different components and registration options it became quite cumbersome to set up and manage, and one envisioned portion of the event needed to be slightly changed as we could not figure out how to make registration for that component work (we ended up taking registrations in person at the event for that portion so it all worked out).

Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,,It's pretty straightforward whether you are just looking to get tickets to an event or get admission handled for your own event. Takes the guess work out of one part of your planning. Also don't feel ripped off like I do when I have to go through Ticketmaster with all of the fees added on there.,Thing I like least is that it isn't popular enough for the big events. Doesn't yet compete with Ticketmaster whom I hate.,,,25-Sep-18
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-May,5-Apr,Positive experience,Eventbrite provides a great tool in which hosting or signing up for events is very straigtforward and provides accurate data of everyone that is attending those events. The ability to print out tickets also provides a valid proof to ensure that only authorized and invited personnel are able to attend.,The algorithm that it uses in order to match events based on your past profile can be improved a little bit as there are a lot of occasions where I have found that the matches are not accurate based on your search and past history,,,16-Sep-18

I have never had any difficulties with using the site nor has it ever crashed or given me errors. I really embrace their style of letting other individuals sell tickets on their site.

That way you will never miss your event.,I don't have anything negative to say. This is my goto software for creating events and would highly recommend it.,,,29-Oct-19
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-May,,5-May,,Overall a great product with value regardless of the version you pick.  Free and paid all have their uses depending on your needs.,I love that I can find events to attend locally via Eventbrite.  But I should also mention that the best part about Eventbrite is how easy they make it create and share events for FREE.,"I have no complaints, I think their ticketing fees are very reasonable.  So for example, you can also use them handle your tickets with a paid account.  Plus it integrates with social media so you get more views!",,,28-Oct-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-Apr,"Eventbrite is our primary system for ticket sales, on site check-in, and one of our systems for communicating updates about the event to pre-registered attendees.","I appreciate that this system is integrated already for check-in on site. If attendees purchase a ticket, then in real time it will reflect their ticket for check-ins.","The guest list requires you to assign a type of ticket to the guest. In some cases they are only getting a specific access, and I am required to create that type of ticket to provide them access.",,,27-Oct-19
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,,5-Apr,,Eventbrite was easy to use and I would say there was no real learning curve to get an event set-up.,I liked how easy the program was to use and that it didn't cost anything to set-up an event and sell tickets.,I didn't like that there weren't more options for how the event would be visually displayed. You couldn't put your own look and feel into the ticketing platform.,,,30-Sep-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-Mar,Really helped us when we threw a large event a few years ago. It was just overpriced for the industry.,Really helped with making our event more professional.,It was too expensive for us to purchase long term.,,,27-Aug-19
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,,5-Mar,,,I appreciate the mobile access & it is fairly easy to use.,Sometimes hard to find your ticket again if you navigate away from it or don't screenshot it. Emails don't always arrive in a timely manner.,,,25-Aug-19
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,,5-May,,,It was really easy to sell tickets via Eventbrite and know how many people to plan for.,Our event is held offsite. Having a spotty internet connection made for long lines at check in.,,,12-Aug-19
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,,5-Apr,,,I liked the ease of being able to RSVP to an event and purchase tickets.,There were a couple of events that I needed to get more information on and had a hard time finding where to request it.,,,29-Jul-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,,I love the ease of the product. It's one of those products that is easy to use and has a great purpose.,"I've never had a real problem with it. Even if I had a question, CS was helpful.",,,16-May-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-Apr,5-May,5-Apr,5-Apr,Great platform for event registration and management.  It is very smooth and functional.,Great platform to manage event registration.,Registration is lengthy for customers/event goers. Wish It was a bit simplified.,,,22-Jan-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,5-May,"Overall Eventbrite is a great platform, I have found out about great events through this platform and also have been able to share my own events. I have the android app and use it on my phone all the time. It is just as easy to use it on the phone and the computer.","It is very easy to use, and I really like the categories and filters, especially when I am looking for a specific type of date, place and cost. Publishing events are also easy and you only have to pay for the service if your event has a cost, if your event is free you don't have to pay to share it.",Sometimes the filters for area don't work really well. Like if I am looking for events in a specific city it also shows me event in cities that are 2 or 3 hours away and that throws me off sometimes. If it showed the events of the selected city and then suggestions for surrounding cities it would be better.,,,20-Dec-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,Event Registration / Attendee Management,I liked the UX/UI experience for users the most. Eventbrite makes it super easy to manage events and also for users to signup and register to attend events. This makes the organization process much nicer to manage  the registration process for events.,"Can't really say there was a big con. But, I guess Eventbrite pushes users to organize their event through their website instead of pushing users to white label and have users signup through their own website for the event.",,,15-Dec-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-Apr,,5-May,5-May,,Eventbrite allows you an easy solution to hosting an event with a classy and seamless appearance,The only downside to Eventbrite is the slight learning curve especially when bringing new people to use the system.,,,14-Dec-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,"Overall, this is a great product to use if you're planning an event!",I love how easy this product makes tracking attendees and it sends reminders automatically!,"The UX design is a little bit cluttered, but that's my only complaint.",,,8-Dec-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,5-Mar,,I use Eventbrite to buy tickets to family friendly and adult oriented local events. I think that a lot of these events would not be able to hold events and sell tickets without a service like Eventbrite to facitiate ticket puraches.,I think the Eventbrite fee should be included in the ticket price so there is no surprises when I go to check out.,,,28-Nov-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,,"It does exactly what I need, which is creating an event for company functions. Managing invites, sending out reminders is a breeze.",Nothing in particular as we only use it occasional and it does what we need.,,,28-Nov-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,"Overall, this is a great product. It makes event planning much easier and managing guests, etc easy as well.","I am able to create festive-looking events, send out invitations, and get responses with much ease. I am able to hide guests if need-be so as not to discourage others from coming. I love that I am able to get responses (RSVPs) quickly using this product.",Sometimes when finding my own photos after an event which I post to this app can get a little tricky. I have to remember to click on the correct link to take me back to the photos I posted.,,,26-Nov-18
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,,5-Apr,,"Overall, this tool has been excellent for smaller use needs!","This tool allows you to easily set up an event, collect payments and provide a list of individuals for your doorman.",Could be a little more robust in terms of functionality,,,22-Nov-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,"I would recommend using Eventbrite to anyone who finds their events schedule a bit overwhelming. The site consolidates your tickets until you need them, and gives  you helpful reminders so that something important 
doesn't slip under the radar.",Eventbrite makes it easy to attend lots of interesting (and sometimes free!) events that address things you like to do. I've personally learned about coding events and other niche topics that I wouldn't have found without the site.,"Sometimes I've had the site's automatic calendar feature be a bit buggy in how it integrates with Google (that is, adding the wrong time zone or event duration). This might be something on the organizer's end however and isn't a huge deterrent to using the software.",,,19-Nov-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,,Eventbrite is a great way to manage invitations for professional events. It's a lot easier than having a dedicated person in your office try to manage all the invitees to your event.,"Not everyone that was invited had an Eventbrite account, but the accounts were easy to set up and eventually everyone got on the same page.",,,13-Nov-18
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-Apr,"General experience is very good. We can use eventbrite for a variety of events (courses, webinars, fundraisers and other social events). It's great for tracking who is attending/participating in the event and it is great for tracking the fiscal portion of the event.","I love the analytics section of the software. Once the event ends, we can see when people bought the tickets and the quantity. This is great for event planning for the future. We can anticipate how long it will take for people to purchase tickets so we can give people ample time.","The fees are slightly high (especially if our ticket sales are in the thousands of dollar range, we end up spending hundreds+ on fees) but it does not deter us from using the software too much.",,,6-Nov-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,5-May,We occasionally use this to schedule appointments rather than using outlook and find it to be an easy way of getting things done.,I like most about this software is I don't have to use outlook!,The email response you get is pretty general and a bit blah.,,,6-Nov-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-Mar,5-Apr,5-Apr,,I found this product is very easy to search for and use. I use it personally as well as for professional reasons.,"Eventbrite is very easy to search for tickets. All I had to do was put in the search box what I wanted and it was there. I like that there are three columns for a search: Event, City or place and Date. This allows the search to be very specific. As a bonus there are categories underneath for specific searches such as free popular events, family time and many more. I like this feature because it allows me to discover tickets for something I might not have thought of. The layout is very easy to use and see. The front has a good mix of colors. All in all I find Eventbrite to be an A+ software.",It's hard for me to ind anything wrong with this software. Everything responds well. I have no complaints on this software.,,,21-Oct-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,5-May,Eventbrite was simple to set up and make our event live. It was very user friendly and took care of payments too.,Eventbrite is so customizable for any type of event.,Nothing really. I didn't have any problems or issues using it.,,,19-Oct-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,,I find that Eventbrite is a great resource for finding events. It's comprehensive and easy to sign up.,I dislike the fees they charge. I know it's inevitable but regardless it's a hassle.,,,10-Oct-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,,Very easy to create an event and find events. Easy payment system and there is the ability to make an event private.,The refund process can be tedious is refunds are allowed.,,,9-Oct-18
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-Apr,,This is the primary software we use for event registration. Its great! Easy-to-use and trusted by most people. We love it.,"One occasion, the software glitches and seems to lose registrations. VERY VER VERY RARE though!",,,26-Sep-18
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-May,5-Apr,5-May,5-Apr,,"Eventbrite makes it easy for individuals and companies to create events and manage all aspects of them all under one platform. Creating an event page, selling tickets, sending updates, collecting emails, and keeping your customers updated are just a few of the main features offered by Eventbrite.",Customer service could definitely be better. Takes a while to hear back.,,,22-Sep-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,,Eventbrite has always been an easy way to purchase or plan events with ticket sales. Nice UX and great support.,"Hard to find larger event tickets on the platform. Other than that, it's a great way to buy and sell tickets!",,,13-Sep-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-Apr,,,"Eventbrite is an excellent product for everything event driven at your business. Be it 1-off employee events or larger client-driven conferences and opportunities, Eventbrite is an awesome tool to cover the majority of your needs. 

I like that they support their core business but also strengthen and add on new features all the time.","I don't like eventbrite for strictly event-driven products, because the company doesn't own a lot of key company information. But it is amazing for getting up off the ground or for 1-off things.",,,10-Sep-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,,I have used this product when purchasing tickets to both concerts and 5k runs. Both types of experiences were positive and easy.,No cons. The software is easy and fast to get through to book events.,,,10-Sep-18
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,,5-May,,,"It's an easy set up, practically done for you. It's connected to all the social media outlets which help boost my events","The upgrade feature is such a hassle, in the past all of the features were listed up front.",,,9-Sep-18
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,,5-Apr,,,I've used EventBrite a few times to find events going on around me and really enjoyed those events. It was simple to use and easy to find events!,"In the times I've used EventBrite, I haven't found any issues with the product.",,,31-Aug-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,,Very easy to set up and use. Free events mean no cost to you or your events. It is very accepted out in the community.,Embedding it into web sites can be awkward. Minor changes in the web page can break how it works for you.,,,15-Aug-18
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-May,The creation and management for tickets for events as well as sales.,I found the program to be intuitive and easy to learn. I was worried that I or other luddites on our team might struggle with it but there was no struggle. Everyone enjoyed and appreciated the ease of the program.,"I was a little intimidated by the system that helps to tailor to the audience you want but was able to use it fairly easily along with everything else. This was new work for me so a lot of the hesitancy was me, not the program.",,,26-Jun-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,,"Mobile app is great. Easy to use and intuitive.
Easy to organize small meetups too.
You can charge for events.",No issues with the product. I really like it. It's easy to use. Maybe make it easy to to share event invite link.,,,26-Jun-18
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-Mar,5-Apr,5-Apr,It's a great tool to use! I've used for multiple events!,"Eventbrite is well known in the community which helps because majority of your customers will have interacted with the platform previously! It is very simple to set up and easy to manage. If you aren't setting up or hosting an event, it is very easy to use to purchase tickets to a community event or function.","The percentage they take for ticket sales is on the higher side. Also, when getting ready for registration or check in, it isn't the easiest thing to figure it.",,,15-Jun-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,,"You do not have to track who did RSVP or not
You can ask participants to contribute the event
User friendly","I have not encountered anything bad with this system.
I use this as a user as well but I do like the simple set up.",,,9-May-18
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Mar,,5-Apr,,,"I like that events are easy to set up with Eventbrite. Almost everything you need to create, market, promote, and share your event is already built-in for your use. Even people who don't often organise events can grasp it easily with this tool.","Whenever I go back to the landing page, I find that it takes too long for me to go to the events I'm managing. There's barely any use for me to go to Eventbrite's home page and not see the things I'm going there for as an administrator.",,,24-Apr-18
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-Apr,5-May,Generally a great platform for event managers. Definitely an innovative way to sell and manage tickets.,"I've used Eventbrite for events with sales and it works very well.
Eventbrite is generally well known and people are comfortable purchasing large tickets through the platform.
Fees are reasonable.
Lots of options and configurability.","Design UI could be a little more user-friendly, but it's not bad. If you're a marketer or experience at all in design, it's no problem, but might potentially be a challenge for a first time user with no experience elsewhere.",,,12-Apr-17
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,,5-May,,,"With a clean and simple website, Eventbrite offers a list of webinars, workshops, discussions and even yoga sessions. It's intuitive way of suggesting events happening near you, by default, will surely come in handy for those looking to spend some time out of the house. It offers tickets to these events, almost always, for free. Creating an account to get in on the fun is no hassle at all.",You could register for an event (virtual in my case) and get no correspondence from the organizers. I recall taking a short trip back home to attend a webinar in the serene comfort of my home only to sit behind my computer like a bum for over 45 minutes. Rather disappointing considering Eventbrite kept reminding me every 5 or so minutes prior to the event's start time.,,,7-Dec-20
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-Apr,5-May,5-May,"Event rite was super easy to use, i had no issues i will be using it again to purchase tickets to other events.",Just like other event ticket sale sites. It's easy to use and there are no hidden fees when you buy tickets to events.,"there was nothing that I did not like about this software, I will be using it again in the future for other events.",,,10-Nov-20
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,Love how easy it is to use. Having it incorporated into Facebook events has been helpful although the automatic import into Facebook doesn't have all the functionality so I don't do it like that anymore.,I like that public events added can reach more people in the EventBrite network. Being able to duplicate similar events and easily email and export attendee lists is helpful.,We charge $5 for most events and the fees at that price are insane and have forced us to use a differnt platform for our $5 events.,,,9-Oct-20
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,Amazing experience with the software and platform in general!,Eventbrite's application is amazing to book/organize events and sell tickets seamlessly for a small charge.

Have never had trouble.",Honestly nothing bad to say about eventbrite. They are great and customer service responds quickly when you need them.,,,16-Sep-20
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-Apr,,,An easy way to organize and schedule important meetings or just some awesome get togethers.,Prepandemic this was my go to product to set up and find networking or other meetings. However the transition to this less face to face contact has been leaving me wanting more.,,,21-Aug-20
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,I've been using Eventbrite for over 2 years. It is awesome for small businesses and busy companies for those who don't have time to put a staff person on selling tickets for an event.,"Eventbrite has made setting up local events so much easier. They process payments, populate lists, and make the entire ticket selling a cinch!","The fees can be a little high (You can pay the fees yourself, or incorporate the fees into the price of the ricket- your choice), but it's worth it for less work on my staff's end.",,,21-Aug-20
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,"Overall, this is a great way to do tickets, a lot better than having to get paper tickets to an event.",I really like being able to order tickets for an event and then having them electronically. That way you don't have to keep track of paper tickets and worry about losing them anymore. You know that all you need to have is your phone at the event and you'll be able to quickly and easily find the tickets in your email.,The only issue I've run into with this is if your phone does not have a good internet connection. Typically you have to click on a link in your email that opens the ticket but if you have no internet that won't work.,,,13-Aug-20
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,,5-Apr,,"It is easy to create an event and find a bunch of events in the local area for a range of prices. Sometimes, the events are not what you are expecting since anyone can make an event.","It is easy to publish and sell tickets to your upcoming event, no matter where or what that event may be.",This software allows anyone to use it. This can be a challenge for fake events or non-authenticated events that are selling tickets. Sometimes people will buy tickets to non-legitimate events and expect something else.,,,31-Jul-20
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,I really enjoy my time with the product. I recommend it to others!,Using Eventbrite is really great when organizing a gathering. I like that it is easy to use and you can register and have everything you need in one place.,When first using the software it can be hard with the details but when you get the hang of it is is simple.,,,30-Jul-20
Eventbrite,5-Mar,5-Mar,,5-Mar,,"Pretty good.  If I'm looking to send out a professional business event to my database, Eventbrite would definitely be on the top of my list to use.  There's more structure there as opposed to like sending the event invitation via personal email.","I use it to set up events and to organize workshops.  When my friends set up events, they usually use Eventbrite to send out invites and it allows the event  planner to keep track of RSVP and sends out the reminders and such.  It's great because it's free for free events.",It's good but I mean there isn't a lot of software out there that really stands out.  It's somewhat user friendly and people are used to using it so it's no wonder people use it.,,,29-May-20
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-Apr,,Overall eventbrite is great and easy to use and is used for so many diffrent events!,Eventbrite is an alternative software which you can use for selling tickets to events it rarely ever crashes!,Eventbrite is so that i can barely think of anything to say! If i have to choose one thing it would be the occasional crashing.,,,29-Apr-20
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,,5-Mar,,We are typically very pleased with the EventBrite experience.,Eventbrite helps us keep our ticket sales organized and together in one place.

Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-Apr,,"I used eventbrite weekly and marketed the events via Facebook, email, etc.","I like that you can create an event and add a lot of details and features, such as maps, rsvp, max people, etc.","I do not like that to rsvp, etc on eventbrite you have to go to the website, rather than just a 1-click from an email or link.",,,15-Feb-20
Eventbrite,5-Mar,5-Mar,,5-Mar,,I run across eventbrite fairly often whenever I seek out tickets to concerts and events.,Probably the thing I like the most is the e-newsletter that alerts me to upcoming events I might like.  Otherwise I don't feel like eventbrite provides enough of a service for me to justify the extra cost I'm paying on top of a ticket.,"Biggest issue for me is how much extra I have to pay just to get a ticket through eventbrite.  And it's not like I have any other options.  If it was a convenience thing that'd be fine, but I hate how I see a ticket price, and then it's automatically going to have a fairly high extra charge and I have no other way of buying at face value (not including tax, of course)",,,13-Feb-20
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,Overall it is very good and user friendly. It makes small events seem more legit,It's super easy to make events. As a Dj I can make events public and look official by making it available on Eventbrite. Having people print tickets or download the ticket on the phone makes your events seem more legit,Sometimes the app gets too clustered and hard to find smaller events. They tend to get washed out by the bigger ones.,,It is very well known and tons of people look at it,9-Jan-20
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-May,,5-Apr,,"over the half dozen uses so far, it hasn't let us down yet. Overall good experience.",can easily create social events for staff and clients in jus a few minutes. its quick and easy to use.,I'm probably reaching for the stars here but I love to have more customizable options. perhaps those options could be expanded a bit,,,5-Jan-20
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-Mar,5-May,5-Apr,Eventbrite is a great way to show people upcoming events in the area that they would be interested in based on past likes.,Eventbrite allows event goers to be notified about events similar to ones they have been to in the past. Great way to increase awareness of events.,Eventbrite can be confusing for first time users because sometimes it isn't the website where you buy the tickets to the event so the users ends up going to multiple sites to buy a ticket.,,,3-Jan-20
Eventbrite,5-May,5-Apr,,5-Apr,,Eventbrite is definitely a necessary program to know about!,Eventbrite makes finding and registering for events and conferences simple.

Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Mar,,5-Mar,,Generally pretty good for a straightforward event announcement.,It captures all the basics about an event and its has been easy for the recipient to open and navigate.,Its a little too basic.  Not alot offered in a way to make the invitation visually attractive. And sometimes the payment mechanism is a little glitchy.,,,10-Dec-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,"I have purchase tickets for events, and even reserved space for events which do not have an admission fee.",I have purchased tickets using eventbrite and I think it's a really easy way to sell tickets and buy tickets for an event.  When used with facebook I think the event owners have access to a great app.,"I think the fees can be high.  I have never been on the admin side of event brite so I can't speak to the ease of use, but on the buyer side, the fees passed off seems high.",,,8-Dec-19
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Mar,,5-May,5-Mar,It's great for larget events that need customized intake forms and attendee communication options.,"Eventbrite offers extensive customizability in attendee registration, reminders and follow up with attendees.",The learning curve can be a little steep and the fees for credit  card processing are not clearlyexpressed.,,,3-Dec-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,"Overall, my experience with Eventbrite was been amazing. The analytics and support provided by this software has helped me to determine the specific demographics that my business is attracting.","I really like that Eventbrite software allows me to advertise events pertaining to my business on a wider scale, which expands my audience and has led to increased revenue.","One aspect that I like least about this software is the abundance of settings that are set to default. While this appears helpful on the surface, there are many settings that I need to manually change and there are times that we do not notice that this is an issue until after the event is posted.",,,27-Nov-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,5-May,I use to allow people to register for events and track registrations and people attenting.,They provide a generous trial options where you can use it for a few events entirely for free and offer very affordable rates to manage invitations and registrations for events.

I've managed events with it and also been a user getting tickets. Always satisfied and never had any issues.,"I don't really have any cons about the site at this time. I have only had good experiences with Eventbrite. I think some things could be even easier, but overall, I give it an A-.",,,18-Sep-19
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,,5-May,,Overall it's easy to use for event promotion and communication as well as registration.,I like that it is easy to organize and promote events through this technology platform. It makes it easy to buy an e-ticket.,I don't like the look and layout of the website. It feels very outdated and could have a new cleaner look to it.,,,7-Sep-19
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,,5-Apr,5-May,Overall I enjoy using this software/platform and would recommend it to anyone looking for events.,"What I like most about Eventbrite is how easy it is to register/RSVP for an event. It also makes finding events easy.

Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-Mar,5-May,5-Mar,"We had a great experience with Eventbrite and would highly recommend, although Facebook Events is now a close competitor in terms of cost and functionality.","It's easy to set up customized events and search for local events. You can easily manage and secure transactions/payments for attendees. It is also an easy way to be able to control number of invitations released and automate the invitation process. You only pay for events where you charge admission, so it doesn't have to be costly for personal or business use.","There are not a lot of marketing capabilities, so you really have to go to the work of publicizing the event to your audience.

There's just the one, or maybe two, templates available so complete branding is not offered. This also goes for the emails as well.",,,23-Jul-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,,The refund policy offered to customers is by far the best part of using Eventbrite!,"I do not like that I need a seperate app to use Eventbrite in business, and one for leisure.",,,6-Jul-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,Overall i will continue to use it because i know what I'm getting,It's reliable and predictable. Every month i have an event my customers know what to expect. It barely takes me 10 minutes to input my event info. And when it's tome to cash out my funds that is easy as pie,Of course the biggest complaint is the service fee but I've learned to adjust my ticket prices to make my full profit,,,4-Jul-19

Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,5-May,Can't beat it for the price & functionality. Also works well in countries outside the US / Europe unlike a lot of systems.,If you mostly use it for free events (like us) - it's completely free. All the main functionality is available in their free tier - very impressive.,Honestly - it's very good. Maybe it'd be nice to have some different designs for the event landing pages but the stock one works pretty well.,,,3-Apr-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,,Great app for storing event tickets to have at the tip of your fingers.  Love the ease of use and searching tools for events near you!,I have used this app a handful of times and have not had any issues or problems.,,,26-Mar-19
Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,,5-Apr,,,This software allows you to quickly create invitations to events. There is a minimum learning curve and suitable templates are available. I found this useful in a pinch.,The con I have regarding this software actually deals with their marketing. The marketing is a bit intrusive and become annoying. Outside of that it is a pretty good resource.,,,20-Mar-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-Apr,,5-Apr,,,"Using it as a mobile app is a lifesaver.  I can't stand having to keep up with paper tickets, and this allows me to keep them quickly accessible on my phone.","As with most mobile apps, i just get a bit paranoid that my ticket info will be lost after i open it once.  I would like a confirmation somewhere stating that the info will not be lost until scanned at admission.",,,26-Feb-19

Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,All in all it's good when you need it and doesn't seem to have too many troubles. Only drawback is you'll need multiple of the same type of app as there are other players in the space,It does not take a long time to load the app and there are no issues between the web/mobile experience.,The only con would be that I don't use it that often. There are other services offering similar products so it isn't used with all events.,,,14-Jan-19
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,,"Pretty straight forward when using Eventbrite, all you do is search for an event you are interested in and buy the tickets on the website.

Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-May,,5-Mar,,It has everything you need to pull off an event and manage the event participants. Definitely the tried and true event technology!,Eventbrite is probably the best player in the events space because it's user-friendly and it has all the capabilities you need to pull off a great event and notify people. It tracks registrants and disseminates the information about the event efficiently.,It's a little clunky and old-fashioned-- the UI could use an update and it can sometimes be complicated to register. Minor things like having to scroll for a long time to select a drop-down option.,,,14-Dec-18

The company should charge one or the other.,,,13-Nov-18

This is a great program to keep track of who's coming and be able to keep the attendees up to date on the event (you can send out emails to the attendees),"If you plan on charging for the event, eventbrite charges you to use their service.

Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-Apr,5-Apr,,"In addition to advertising on MeetUp, we utilize Eventbrite for recruiting non employees to our user studies, promotional events and select happy hours.  The tool is affordable, and fees can be passed directly to ticket purchasers.  Indexing optimal--making our events easily discoverable across both Google and Facebook.  Analytics tools are intuitive and useful for measuring our growth and success.","Increased visual customization would be appreciated.  Currently, pages have the same general look and feel, limiting the ability to further stand out.

For online payments: Eventbrite gives you a secure option and takes a small percentage of your ticket sales in return.","I wish they had an ""SOS"" button. Events already hectic and stressful.

Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,,5-May,,,The ticket buying experience is very straight forward and easy. Also customer service is very easy to reach.,"The service fee is a little steep. This seems like an industry standard to charge a fee for each ticket but a way in which Eventbrite could really differentiate itself from other ticket vendors would be to charge one service fee per transaction, rather then per ticket.

Eventbrite,5-Jan,5-Jan,5-Jan,5-Jan,5-Jan,"I bought tickets for Event Brite's Cinco de Mayo bar crawl in Asbury Park back in May. It clearly stated on the tickets that there would be a person there to check you into the bar crawl until 7pm that day at the Asbury Ale House. I arrived at the Asbury Ale House at 6:30pm and there was no one there to check us in. We got no wrist bands and no sombreros or whatever we were supposed to receive. I asked the bar tenders and hostesses at the Ale House about it and they informed me that the person running the bar crawl left at 5pm! I couldn't believe it. So, I did my own bar crawl and lost money to a stupid company that didn't give me anything I paid for. Then to go further I filed a claim with my bank to get the money back because I emailed Event Brite and they didn't respond. Go figure. So, the bank gave me a temporary refund and I just got a letter in the mail today that says they are taking the money back because Event Brite basically said they won't give the refund. I will not recommend this company to anyone. I will never be using it again.

Eventbrite,5-Apr,5-Apr,,5-Apr,,Overall I think it's much better than having people respond in an email and having to track everything yourself.,I like that this is something that everyone can easily respond to. It also collects the information on the RSVPs and organized them for you.  I get a higher response rate when sending this out versus just an email.,Overall I like this.

It is a simple and intuitive software that allows almost anyone to publish events. It has a great search feature and allows you to easily implement payment for tickets that you want to charge for.,The only complaint I have with this software is it is too easy to list an event.

You do have multiple payment options but if you do not use there chosen option then many of the features do not work. They only have one payout method.

Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,5-May,"Overall, my experience with Eventbrite has been good and I would highly reccomend for others to give it a try. It's especially beneficial if you or your organization host a lot of events, such as parties, throughout the year. There are a few features that I do not like but regardless, it is still very beneficial to use.","I would highly reccomend for any organization that hosts a lot of events to begin using Eventbrite to promote and use it for providing the admissions passes. It is such a great tool to use as it allows us to not have to create physical invitations and rather, we can mass send to everyone that we wish to invite to our event. This not only helps save resources, but also financially.","What I like least about Eventbrite is that since the events are viewable by the public, many people may accidently sign up to your event  and as a result, you may end up preparing for guests that never show up. This is a major con when using Eventbrite and so it is important to follow up guests after giving them admission passes to confirm that they are coming.",,,21-Nov-18

The software is very creative and allows you to create a very effective registration page. The software is free to use as long as you don't require ticket payments.,"When you purchase the paid portion of the software it is very rigid. The customer service is also very slow and lacking. The software also has some issues with how you receive the revenue from your event. From experience they keep your revenue until the event is over, which may be problematic to individuals trying to use that income to further promote their event. The platform is also over used and i have concerns about certain safety and privacy features.",,,11-Oct-18

Again, it's well enough put together that it's not a major headache to use, and there are some nice automations, but besides the ""good enough-ness"" of it, I chose to use it because they're pretty much the industry standard for doing online ticket sales for self-promoted events.","Pretty easy to set up an event, good depth of features that more than covered my basic needs, some nice inbuilt featuers like automated email reminders before the event.","No mobile application to manage an event in detail, the user interface and experience is a bit rough around the edges (for example, went in circles for a while to get the event created in the first place - not a well designed workflow).",,,21-Nov-20

It has been a great way for us to stay connected in office and promote product outside of the office to reach as many end users as possible.,"I have nothing negative to say, really. I think twice now while uploading new events or editing event information, the software froze or crashed without auto-saving the information that was already started.",,,12-Jul-18

It's easy to use, really accessible, and straightforward.","It's easy to post on Eventbrite, and is a good starting place if you don't have a large marketing budget for your events. It has a large audience, which means the opportunity for exposure.","There have been times where the original time that was input for an event was created, and when going back a week later, the time changed somehow...this happened to me twice. The other downside is that because it's such a large audience, it's difficult to target specific, ideal, people.",,,18-Jun-18

Eventbrite,5-Jan,5-Jan,5-Jan,5-Jan,5-Jan,For the 2nd time I have received an 'oops' message from you reading payment.  I agreed to use event brite due to the flexibility of weekly payments.  You have been selling tickets for my event for 5 weeks now and I have not received a penny.  Instead I got some rubbish about my bank rejecting the payment to start with I checked with my bank and they have no record of any attempt at payment from yourself then you say its because the sort code was wrong which it wasn't however i re inputted the details again and today another message saying there is a problem.   My event is less than 3 weeks away and i have bills that should have been paid 2 weeks ago.  Your company is a disgrace holding on to small businesses money and telling lies.  I will not be using or recommending your company again.   I am speaking with my lawyer on Monday as I may have to cancel this event if payment is not made to me as I do not have the funds to cover the costs of my outstanding bills for my event and your guys will be picking up the tab and explaining to my clients why this has happened.,,,,,13-Aug-16
Eventbrite,5-May,5-May,5-May,,,"I plan events for several groups in town and Eventbrite is simply the best tool for all my needs from start to finish. It's easy for guests to sign up for the event, but my favorite part is the check in app. It's the worst when you get to an event and there's a huge line because the organizers have to manually check off arrivals. But with the app, it's so quick and easy, we can zip people right through.  Plus, we have a great rep in Boston. Highly recommend!",,,,,28-Jul-14

However, we did not use it long enough to maybe fully understand it.",,,20-Feb-20
Eventbrite,5-Mar,5-Mar,5-Feb,5-Mar,5-Jan,Overall experience was negative. Eventbrite not only put up prices - twice - but then developed a no refund policy. Crazy when there are always people who are not able to attend at the last minute for very good reasons.  If I had stayed with Eventbrite my numbers would have been severely reduced.  Putting profits before people is the opposite of the event management site I now recommend to all and sundry.,It was easy to use.

Users are in tune and being trained with short, sweet, and to the point messages. At times, the page has key information in too many places that makes it hard to get the quick version of the event.",,,8-Jan-19

 Also wondered why my bank statements and 1099 form didn't add up??
 Apparently they 1099 you on the fees they keep as there own service charge!!!!
Customer service couldn't even tell me that. My accountants had to figure it out on there own.
Did over 150k in ticket revenue with them last year. They will get $00 this year..
Check out Ticket Tailor. (This is not a plug) look for yourself. They have flat rate fees that are pretty reasonable in my book. And much easier to justify come tax time!!!
